Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see</span>? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-2075">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-2078">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-2078">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

<span class="marked id-unique-1933">Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-1935">way</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-1936">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1945">shows</span> is, they <span class="marked id-unique-1946">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1928">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1942">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-1938">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1950">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-1951">pilot</span>. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-1954">show</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-1956">show</span> to the

<span class="marked id-unique-1939">show</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-1962">decide</span> if <span class="marked id-unique-1949">they're</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1964">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-1936">make</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-1965">shows</span>. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-1930">pilots</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1968">get</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1969">picked</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-1970">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1953">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1973">programs</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-1975">don't</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1943">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1977">nothing</span>.

place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his

righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-2075">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-2078">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-2078">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-2075">gonna tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-2078">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some

don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-2625">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

<span class="marked id-unique-2628">Like you, I <span class="marked id-unique-2580">used</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-2600">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-2637">world</span> was this <span class="marked id-unique-2638">great</span>

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-4822">bones don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4823">break, <span class="marked id-unique-4824">mine</span> do. <span class="marked id-unique-4825">That's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4827">clear</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-4829">react</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4830">bacteria</span> and viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4786">differently than mine</span>. You

<span class="marked id-unique-4805">reason</span>, you and I react</span> the exact same way to <span class="marked id-unique-4776">water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-4833">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke</span>. We <span class="marked id-unique-4834">get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-4835">lungs</span>,

you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-4843">curve</span>, just</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-4844">opposite ends</span>.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-4848">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-4848">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-4735">way they make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4740">shows is, they <span class="marked id-unique-4743">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4752">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4738">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-4754">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4747">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-4742">pilot</span>. Then they show</span> that show to the
people who <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make shows</span>, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-4846">strength of that <span class="marked id-unique-4752">one</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4755">show</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-4759">decide</span> if <span class="marked id-unique-4746">they're</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4826">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make</span> more shows</span>. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-4731">pilots <span class="marked id-unique-4763">get</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4764">picked</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-4765">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4851">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4768">programs</span>. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-4770">don't</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4852">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4773">nothing</span>. She <span class="marked id-unique-4774">starred</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-4767">one</span> of the ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-4777">became nothing</span>.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-4881">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-4848">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-4848">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The <span class="marked id-unique-4779">path of the righteous</span> man is beset on all <span class="marked id-unique-4766">sides by

Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-4735">way they make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4740">shows is, they <span class="marked id-unique-4743">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4752">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4738">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-4754">show's</span> called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-4742">pilot. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-4729">show</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-4736">show</span> to the
<span class="marked id-unique-4737">people</span> who <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4751">shows</span>, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-4846">strength</span> of that <span class="marked id-unique-4752">one</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4755">show</span> they decide</span> if they're going to <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make more shows</span>. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-4731">pilots get</span> picked and <span class="marked id-unique-4765">become <span class="marked id-unique-4851">television</span> programs</span>. Some
don't, become <span class="marked id-unique-4773">nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-4774">starred</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-4767">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-4775">ones</span> that
became</span> nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-4848">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

<span class="marked id-unique-4801">Now that we <span class="marked id-unique-4803">know</span> who you are, I know</span> who I am. I'm not a
<span class="marked id-unique-4806">mistake! It all makes</span> sense! In a <span class="marked id-unique-4809">comic, you <span class="marked id-unique-4789">know</span> how you
can</span> tell who the arch-villain's going to be? <span class="marked id-unique-4854">He's the exact</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4859">opposite of the <span class="marked id-unique-4855">hero</span>. And most times</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4813">they're friends</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4856">like
you and me! I should've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4814">known <span class="marked id-unique-4815">way</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4816">back</span> when... You <span class="marked id-unique-4817">know</span>
why, <span class="marked id-unique-4849">David</span>? Because of the kids</span>. They called me Mr <span class="marked id-unique-4820">Glass.

The path</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-4780">righteous man is <span class="marked id-unique-4781">beset</span> on all <span class="marked id-unique-4766">sides</span> by

Well, the way they <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make shows</span> is, they make <span class="marked id-unique-4752">one <span class="marked id-unique-4738">show</span>. That
show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4747">called a <span class="marked id-unique-4742">pilot</span>. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-4729">show</span> that show</span> to the
<span class="marked id-unique-4737">people who <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4751">shows</span>, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-4846">strength</span> of that one</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4755">show they <span class="marked id-unique-4759">decide</span> if <span class="marked id-unique-4746">they're</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4826">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4850">make</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-4760">shows</span>. Some

the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an

<span class="marked id-unique-4733">Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-4735">way</span> they make</span> shows is, they <span class="marked id-unique-4743">make <span class="marked id-unique-4752">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4738">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-4754">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4747">called</span> a pilot</span>. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-4729">show that show</span> to the

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Do you <span class="marked id-unique-4862">see any Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you <span class="marked id-unique-4864">see a <span class="marked id-unique-4748">slender</span>

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-5102">bones</span> don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5103">break, <span class="marked id-unique-5104">mine</span> do. <span class="marked id-unique-5105">That's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5108">clear</span>. Your <span class="marked id-unique-5109">cells</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5110">react</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5112">bacteria</span> and viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5059">differently than mine</span>. You
<span class="marked id-unique-5087">don't <span class="marked id-unique-5113">get</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4995">sick</span>, I do. <span class="marked id-unique-5105">That's</span> also <span class="marked id-unique-5114">clear</span>. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-5081">reason</span>, you and I react</span> the exact same way to <span class="marked id-unique-5045">water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-5115">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke</span>. We <span class="marked id-unique-5117">get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-5118">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-5120">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5122">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5123">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-5124">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5126">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-5127">connected</span>,
you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-5128">curve</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5129">just</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-5131">opposite</span> ends</span>.

You <span class="marked id-unique-5132">see? It's curious</span>. Ted did <span class="marked id-unique-5133">figure it out - time</span>
travel. And when we <span class="marked id-unique-5130">get <span class="marked id-unique-5135">back</span>, we gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5137">tell everyone</span>. How
it's <span class="marked id-unique-4999">possible, how it's done</span>, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty <span class="marked id-unique-5138">years in the <span class="marked id-unique-5139">future</span> when the <span class="marked id-unique-5140">spacecraft</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5141">encounters</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-5142">black</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5004">hole</span> does the <span class="marked id-unique-5143">computer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5145">call</span> it an

<span class="marked id-unique-5148">know</span>, that <span class="marked id-unique-5150">means</span> we <span class="marked id-unique-5151">never</span> told</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5153">anyone. And if we never</span>
told <span class="marked id-unique-5116">anyone it <span class="marked id-unique-5150">means</span> we never</span> made it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-5154">Just as a matter</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5156">deductive <span class="marked id-unique-5157">logic</span>.

Well</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-4998">way they make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5007">shows is, they <span class="marked id-unique-5010">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5020">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5005">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-5022">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5014">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-5009">pilot</span>. Then they show</span> that show to the

<span class="marked id-unique-5046">became <span class="marked id-unique-5162">nothing</span>.

Like</span> you, I used to think the world was this <span class="marked id-unique-5163">great
<span class="marked id-unique-5164">place</span> where <span class="marked id-unique-5166">everybody</span> lived</span> by the same <span class="marked id-unique-5167">standards I did,
then some <span class="marked id-unique-5168">kid</span> with a <span class="marked id-unique-5169">nail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5121">showed</span> me I was <span class="marked id-unique-5170">living</span> in his

righteousness is not <span class="marked id-unique-5155">rewarded. That's</span> Cesar's <span class="marked id-unique-5176">world, and
if <span class="marked id-unique-5177">you're</span> not willing</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5178">play by his <span class="marked id-unique-5179">rules</span>, then <span class="marked id-unique-5106">you're</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-5077">Now</span> that we <span class="marked id-unique-5079">know</span> who you are, I know</span> who I am. I'm not a

You see? It's curious. <span class="marked id-unique-5235">Ted did figure</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-5237">out - time
<span class="marked id-unique-5183">travel</span>. And when we <span class="marked id-unique-5130">get</span> back</span>, we <span class="marked id-unique-5238">gonna <span class="marked id-unique-5137">tell</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5171">everyone</span>. How
it's possible</span>, how it's done, what the <span class="marked id-unique-5244">dangers are. But
then why <span class="marked id-unique-5245">fifty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5138">years</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-5139">future</span> when the <span class="marked id-unique-5140">spacecraft</span>

'<span class="marked id-unique-5240">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5066">entry</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5119">event'</span>? Why don't</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-5147">know? If they don't</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5148">know, that <span class="marked id-unique-5150">means</span> we <span class="marked id-unique-5151">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5019">told</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5153">anyone</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-5077">Now</span> that we <span class="marked id-unique-5079">know</span> who you are, I <span class="marked id-unique-5080">know</span> who I am. I'm not a

can</span> tell who the arch-villain's <span class="marked id-unique-5086">going to be? He's</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5088">exact

<span class="marked id-unique-5110">react</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5112">bacteria</span> and viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5059">differently than mine</span>. You

<span class="marked id-unique-5081">reason</span>, you and I react</span> the exact same way to <span class="marked id-unique-5045">water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-5115">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke</span>. We <span class="marked id-unique-5117">get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-5118">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-5120">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5122">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5123">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-5124">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5126">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-5127">connected</span>,
you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-5128">curve</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5129">just</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-5131">opposite</span> ends</span>.

You <span class="marked id-unique-5132">see? It's curious</span>. Ted did <span class="marked id-unique-5133">figure it out - time</span>
travel. And when we <span class="marked id-unique-5130">get <span class="marked id-unique-5135">back</span>, we gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5137">tell everyone</span>. How
it's <span class="marked id-unique-4999">possible, how it's done</span>, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty <span class="marked id-unique-5138">years in the <span class="marked id-unique-5139">future</span> when the <span class="marked id-unique-5140">spacecraft</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5141">encounters</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-5142">black</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5004">hole</span> does the <span class="marked id-unique-5143">computer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5145">call</span> it an

<span class="marked id-unique-5148">know</span>, that <span class="marked id-unique-5150">means</span> we <span class="marked id-unique-5151">never</span> told</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5153">anyone. And if we never</span>
told <span class="marked id-unique-5116">anyone it <span class="marked id-unique-5150">means</span> we never</span> made it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-5154">Just as a matter</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5156">deductive <span class="marked id-unique-5157">logic</span>.

Well</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-4998">way they make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5007">shows is, they <span class="marked id-unique-5010">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5020">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5005">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-5022">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5014">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-5009">pilot</span>. Then they show</span> that show to the
people who <span class="marked id-unique-5158">make shows</span>, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-5136">strength of that <span class="marked id-unique-5020">one</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5023">show</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-5027">decide</span> if <span class="marked id-unique-5013">they're</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5107">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5158">make</span> more shows</span>. Some

Like</span> you, I used to think the world was this <span class="marked id-unique-5163">great
<span class="marked id-unique-5164">place</span> where <span class="marked id-unique-5166">everybody</span> lived</span> by the same <span class="marked id-unique-5167">standards I did,
then some <span class="marked id-unique-5168">kid</span> with a <span class="marked id-unique-5169">nail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5121">showed</span> me I was <span class="marked id-unique-5170">living</span> in his

righteousness is not <span class="marked id-unique-5155">rewarded. That's</span> Cesar's <span class="marked id-unique-5176">world, and
if <span class="marked id-unique-5177">you're</span> not willing</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5178">play by his <span class="marked id-unique-5179">rules</span>, then <span class="marked id-unique-5106">you're</span>
gonna</span> have to <span class="marked id-unique-5180">pay the <span class="marked id-unique-5181">price</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-5077">Now</span> that we <span class="marked id-unique-5079">know</span> who you are, I know</span> who I am. I'm not a

<span class="marked id-unique-5149">Like you, I <span class="marked id-unique-5057">used</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5111">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5189">world</span> was this <span class="marked id-unique-5163">great</span>

we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-5298">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Like you, I <span class="marked id-unique-5266">used to <span class="marked id-unique-5283">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5323">world</span> was this <span class="marked id-unique-5308">great</span>

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great

then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his

lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great

then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is <span class="marked id-unique-6326">case</span> they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that <span class="marked id-unique-6327">makes</span> a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals <span class="marked id-unique-6325">can't</span> manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna <span class="marked id-unique-6353">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-6328">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-6329">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna <span class="marked id-unique-6353">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-6338">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the

show they <span class="marked id-unique-6348">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-6337">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-6339">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-6331">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6336">programs</span>. Some

you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-6325">can't</span> give you this <span class="marked id-unique-6326">case</span>, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-6328">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, <span class="marked id-unique-6329">just</span> because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a

turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-6328">made</span> it out. Now we took an

snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-6338">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun

of that shit.

the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied

You see? It's curious. <span class="marked id-unique-6477">Ted</span> did figure it out - time
<span class="marked id-unique-6476">travel</span>. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's <span class="marked id-unique-6479">possible</span>, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty <span class="marked id-unique-6474">years</span> in the future when the <span class="marked id-unique-6478">spacecraft</span>
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'<span class="marked id-unique-6475">unknown</span> entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I <span class="marked id-unique-6471">like</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6408">animals</span> better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every

you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they <span class="marked id-unique-6442">got</span> different dogs for different people. <span class="marked id-unique-6471">Like</span> pit

then some <span class="marked id-unique-6521">kid</span> with a <span class="marked id-unique-6518">nail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6510">showed</span> me I was <span class="marked id-unique-6519">living</span> in his

<span class="marked id-unique-6511">righteousness</span> is not <span class="marked id-unique-6512">rewarded</span>. That's <span class="marked id-unique-6524">Cesar's</span> world, and

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a

opposite of the <span class="marked id-unique-6561">hero</span>. And most <span class="marked id-unique-6531">times</span> they're <span class="marked id-unique-6564">friends</span>, like
you and me! I <span class="marked id-unique-6539">should've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6556">known</span> way back when... You know

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to <span class="marked id-unique-6616">water</span>. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the <span class="marked id-unique-6667">tyranny</span> of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the <span class="marked id-unique-6665">weak</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-6666">valley</span> of darkness,
for he is <span class="marked id-unique-6668">truly</span> his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

You <span class="marked id-unique-6664">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6616">water</span> moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and <span class="marked id-unique-6615">got</span> a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
<span class="marked id-unique-6636">us</span> a week to climb out. <span class="marked id-unique-6635">Now</span>, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of <span class="marked id-unique-6636">us</span> survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-6662">made</span> it out. <span class="marked id-unique-6635">Now</span> we took an
oath, that I'm breaking <span class="marked id-unique-6635">now</span>. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Like you, I <span class="marked id-unique-6618">used</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-6664">think</span> the world was this great
<span class="marked id-unique-6625">place</span> where <span class="marked id-unique-6632">everybody</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6630">lived</span> by the same <span class="marked id-unique-6619">standards</span> I did,
then some <span class="marked id-unique-6631">kid</span> with a <span class="marked id-unique-6628">nail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6620">showed</span> me I was <span class="marked id-unique-6629">living</span> in his
world, a world where <span class="marked id-unique-6633">chaos</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6663">rules</span> not <span class="marked id-unique-6627">order</span>, a world where
<span class="marked id-unique-6621">righteousness</span> is not <span class="marked id-unique-6622">rewarded</span>. That's <span class="marked id-unique-6634">Cesar's</span> world, and
if you're not <span class="marked id-unique-6617">willing</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-6624">play</span> by his <span class="marked id-unique-6663">rules</span>, then you're

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and <span class="marked id-unique-7719">viruses</span> differently than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-7722">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-7724">reason</span>, you and I react the <span class="marked id-unique-7718">exact</span> same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-7721">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However <span class="marked id-unique-7720">unreal</span> it may <span class="marked id-unique-7723">seem</span>, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, <span class="marked id-unique-7644">just</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-7716">opposite</span> ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-7708">gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7642">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span>? If they don't
<span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-7645">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-7644">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make <span class="marked id-unique-7715">one</span> show. That
show's <span class="marked id-unique-7707">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-7697">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the

<span class="marked id-unique-7696">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-7698">picked</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-7711">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7692">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7695">programs</span>. Some
don't, <span class="marked id-unique-7711">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7710">nothing</span>. She <span class="marked id-unique-7694">starred</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-7715">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-7699">ones</span> that

place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is <span class="marked id-unique-7691">case</span> they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that <span class="marked id-unique-7641">makes</span> a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals <span class="marked id-unique-7646">can't</span> manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless <span class="marked id-unique-7712">they're</span> continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-7708">gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7642">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span>? If they don't
<span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-7645">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-7644">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like <span class="marked id-unique-7712">they're</span> actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm <span class="marked id-unique-7708">gonna</span> shoot you in the

the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-7708">gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7642">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make <span class="marked id-unique-7715">one</span> show. That

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-7646">can't</span> give you this <span class="marked id-unique-7691">case</span>, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this <span class="marked id-unique-7691">case</span> to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-7645">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, <span class="marked id-unique-7644">just</span> because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
<span class="marked id-unique-7706">glass</span> motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> who you are, I <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> who I am. I'm not a

<span class="marked id-unique-7721">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However <span class="marked id-unique-7720">unreal</span> it may <span class="marked id-unique-7723">seem</span>, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, <span class="marked id-unique-7644">just</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-7716">opposite</span> ends.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my <span class="marked id-unique-7647">name</span> printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think <span class="marked id-unique-7643">you're</span> in
a toy store, because <span class="marked id-unique-7643">you're</span> here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and <span class="marked id-unique-7719">viruses</span> differently than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-7722">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-7645">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> who you are, I <span class="marked id-unique-7714">know</span> who I am. I'm not a

Well, the way they make shows is, they make <span class="marked id-unique-7715">one</span> show. That
show's <span class="marked id-unique-7707">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-7697">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like <span class="marked id-unique-7712">they're</span> actually proud
of that shit.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my <span class="marked id-unique-7647">name</span> printed on

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good

for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-7766">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-7765">break</span>, mine do. <span class="marked id-unique-7744">That's</span> clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-7764">cells</span>

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the <span class="marked id-unique-7725">animals</span> is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The <span class="marked id-unique-7725">animals</span> can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

plastic <span class="marked id-unique-7797">tag</span> clipped to my <span class="marked id-unique-7801">shirt</span> with my name printed on

that <span class="marked id-unique-7802">shakes</span> when you <span class="marked id-unique-7804">put</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7803">quarters</span> in it? No? <span class="marked id-unique-7768">Well</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-7744">that's</span>

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's <span class="marked id-unique-7934">called</span> a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if <span class="marked id-unique-7933">they're</span> going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's <span class="marked id-unique-7857">curious</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-7839">Ted</span> did <span class="marked id-unique-7848">figure</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-7842">out - time</span>

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my <span class="marked id-unique-7891">name</span> printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think <span class="marked id-unique-7935">you're</span> in
a toy store, because <span class="marked id-unique-7935">you're</span> here shopping for an infant

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's <span class="marked id-unique-7934">called</span> a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if <span class="marked id-unique-7933">they're</span> going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to <span class="marked id-unique-7986">water</span>. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, <span class="marked id-unique-7990">just</span> on opposite ends.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must <span class="marked id-unique-7989">think</span> you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever <span class="marked id-unique-7982">got</span> off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by <span class="marked id-unique-7987">us</span>, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-8922">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-8921">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-8920">cells</span>

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think <span class="marked id-unique-8902">you're</span> in

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the

island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that <span class="marked id-unique-8845">makes</span> a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals <span class="marked id-unique-8843">can't</span> manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna <span class="marked id-unique-8871">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a

you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-8843">can't</span> give you this <span class="marked id-unique-8844">case</span>, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-8846">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the

men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
<span class="marked id-unique-8956">can</span> tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-8953">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-8952">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-8951">cells</span>

encounters a black hole does the computer call it an

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the <span class="marked id-unique-8924">animals</span> is case they ever <span class="marked id-unique-8958">got</span> off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The <span class="marked id-unique-8924">animals</span> can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Yeah, I like <span class="marked id-unique-8924">animals</span> better than people

a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-9060">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-9049">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-9090">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-9059">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-9061">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-9046">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9057">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-9050">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-9063">ones</span> that

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

<span class="marked id-unique-9149">Now</span> that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the <span class="marked id-unique-9152">weak</span> through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever <span class="marked id-unique-9103">got</span> off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by <span class="marked id-unique-9148">us</span>, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You think <span class="marked id-unique-9105">water</span> moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and <span class="marked id-unique-9103">got</span> a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
<span class="marked id-unique-9148">us</span> a week to climb out. <span class="marked id-unique-9149">Now</span>, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of <span class="marked id-unique-9148">us</span> survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-9150">made</span> it out. <span class="marked id-unique-9149">Now</span> we took an
oath, that I'm breaking <span class="marked id-unique-9149">now</span>. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

<span class="marked id-unique-9113">place</span> where <span class="marked id-unique-9120">everybody</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9118">lived</span> by the same <span class="marked id-unique-9107">standards</span> I did,
