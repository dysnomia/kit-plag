Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-1470">gonna tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1473">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1473">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

Yeah, I like animals better than people

they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1917">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-4332">way they <span class="marked id-unique-4333">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4334">shows</span> is, they <span class="marked id-unique-4335">make</span> one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4325">show. That

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-4327">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of

mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

<span class="marked id-unique-4383">Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-4332">way</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-4333">make</span> shows</span> is, they make <span class="marked id-unique-4330">one <span class="marked id-unique-4325">show</span>. That

<span class="marked id-unique-4337">show</span> they decide</span> if they're <span class="marked id-unique-4308">going to make</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-4344">shows. Some

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves

Do you <span class="marked id-unique-4355">see any <span class="marked id-unique-4356">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you <span class="marked id-unique-4378">see</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-4357">slender</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-4457">sometimes</span>... Especially</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4462">dogs. <span class="marked id-unique-4422">Dogs</span> are the <span class="marked id-unique-4468">best</span>. Every</span>

That
<span class="marked id-unique-4503">show's</span> called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-4504">pilot. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-4505">show</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-4445">show</span> to the

You <span class="marked id-unique-4440">see</span>? It's curious</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4432">Ted did <span class="marked id-unique-4405">figure</span> it out - time</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-4466">Yeah</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-4467">like</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4435">animals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4423">better</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-4398">people</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4457">sometimes</span>... Especially</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4462">dogs. <span class="marked id-unique-4422">Dogs</span> are the <span class="marked id-unique-4468">best</span>. Every</span>

That
<span class="marked id-unique-4503">show's</span> called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-4504">pilot. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-4505">show</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-4445">show</span> to the

<span class="marked id-unique-4502">show</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-4507">decide</span> if <span class="marked id-unique-4508">they're</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4416">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4498">make</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-4509">shows</span>.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and <span class="marked id-unique-6012">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6023">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-6015">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-6017">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-6014">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-6026">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-6019">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-6022">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-6020">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6013">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-6018">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6016">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-6025">connected</span>,

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals <span class="marked id-unique-5976">better</span> than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the <span class="marked id-unique-5977">right</span> man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. <span class="marked id-unique-5977">Right</span>, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-5983">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-5979">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-5986">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-5982">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-5984">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-5978">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5981">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-5980">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-5985">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-5987">became</span> nothing.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-5977">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it <span class="marked id-unique-5977">right</span> for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he <span class="marked id-unique-5976">better</span> paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-5983">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-5979">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-5986">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-5982">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-5984">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-5978">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5981">programs</span>. Some

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-5977">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

<span class="marked id-unique-6090">encounters</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-6106">black</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6081">hole</span> does the <span class="marked id-unique-6100">computer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6103">call</span> it an
'<span class="marked id-unique-6058">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6088">entry</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6087">event'</span>? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. <span class="marked id-unique-6082">Hence</span> we die
down here. Just as a <span class="marked id-unique-6077">matter</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-6094">deductive</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6079">logic</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-6028">Yeah</span>, I like <span class="marked id-unique-6053">animals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6046">better</span> than people
<span class="marked id-unique-6033">sometimes</span>... <span class="marked id-unique-6041">Especially</span> dogs. Dogs are the <span class="marked id-unique-6052">best</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-6040">Every</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6031">time</span> you <span class="marked id-unique-6043">come</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6037">home</span>, they <span class="marked id-unique-6045">act</span> like they <span class="marked id-unique-6038">haven't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6034">seen</span>
you in a <span class="marked id-unique-6027">year</span>. And the good <span class="marked id-unique-6032">thing</span> about dogs... is
they got <span class="marked id-unique-6050">different</span> dogs for <span class="marked id-unique-6050">different</span> people. Like <span class="marked id-unique-6054">pit</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6044">bulls</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-6049">dog</span> of dogs. <span class="marked id-unique-6054">Pit</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6051">bull</span> can be the <span class="marked id-unique-6116">right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6048">man's</span>

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-6072">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-6063">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-6095">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-6071">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-6073">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-6060">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6069">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-6064">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-6075">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-6107">became</span> nothing.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-6105">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-6104">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-6102">cells</span>

You see? It's curious. <span class="marked id-unique-6193">Ted</span> did figure it out - time
<span class="marked id-unique-6192">travel</span>. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's <span class="marked id-unique-6195">possible</span>, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty <span class="marked id-unique-6190">years</span> in the future when the <span class="marked id-unique-6194">spacecraft</span>
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'<span class="marked id-unique-6191">unknown</span> entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I <span class="marked id-unique-6187">like</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6124">animals</span> better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act <span class="marked id-unique-6187">like</span> they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they <span class="marked id-unique-6158">got</span> different dogs for different people. <span class="marked id-unique-6187">Like</span> pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull <span class="marked id-unique-6156">can</span> be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You <span class="marked id-unique-6188">going</span>
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That

don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-7279">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it <span class="marked id-unique-7279">right</span> for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he <span class="marked id-unique-7304">better</span> paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-7330">curve</span>, just on opposite <span class="marked id-unique-7327">ends</span>.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-7279">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Do you see any <span class="marked id-unique-7280">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you see a <span class="marked id-unique-7282">slender</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-7290">plastic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7281">tag</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7300">clipped</span> to my <span class="marked id-unique-7285">shirt</span> with my name <span class="marked id-unique-7289">printed</span> on

what you see at a <span class="marked id-unique-7315">toy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7316">store</span>. And you <span class="marked id-unique-7293">must</span> think you're in

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Your bones don't break, <span class="marked id-unique-7404">mine</span> do. <span class="marked id-unique-7401">That's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7405">clear</span>. Your cells

You <span class="marked id-unique-7396">see</span>? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

we drown. <span class="marked id-unique-7426">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7411">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-7424">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7417">seem</span>, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite <span class="marked id-unique-7427">ends</span>.

You <span class="marked id-unique-7396">see</span>? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

You see? It's <span class="marked id-unique-7495">curious</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-7477">Ted</span> did <span class="marked id-unique-7486">figure</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-7480">out - time</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-7476">travel</span>. And when we <span class="marked id-unique-7449">get</span> back, we gonna tell <span class="marked id-unique-7488">everyone</span>. How
it's <span class="marked id-unique-7479">possible</span>, how it's <span class="marked id-unique-7492">done</span>, what the <span class="marked id-unique-7494">dangers</span> are. But

Yeah, I <span class="marked id-unique-7445">like</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7428">animals</span> better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act <span class="marked id-unique-7445">like</span> they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. <span class="marked id-unique-7445">Like</span> pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull <span class="marked id-unique-7448">can</span> be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You <span class="marked id-unique-7446">going</span>
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Yeah, I <span class="marked id-unique-7445">like</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7428">animals</span> better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act <span class="marked id-unique-7445">like</span> they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. <span class="marked id-unique-7445">Like</span> pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull <span class="marked id-unique-7448">can</span> be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You <span class="marked id-unique-7446">going</span>
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the

Yeah, I like animals better than people

you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

You <span class="marked id-unique-7534">think</span> water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Like you, I used to <span class="marked id-unique-7534">think</span> the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and <span class="marked id-unique-8542">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8553">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-8545">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-8547">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-8544">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-8549">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-8552">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-8550">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8543">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-8548">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8546">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-8555">connected</span>,

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals <span class="marked id-unique-8506">better</span> than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the <span class="marked id-unique-8507">right</span> man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. <span class="marked id-unique-8507">Right</span>, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That

show they <span class="marked id-unique-8516">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-8512">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-8514">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-8508">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8511">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-8510">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-8515">ones</span> that

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-8507">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it <span class="marked id-unique-8507">right</span> for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he <span class="marked id-unique-8506">better</span> paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells

<span class="marked id-unique-8547">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-8544">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-8549">lungs</span>,

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-8513">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-8509">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-8516">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-8512">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-8514">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-8508">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8511">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-8510">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-8515">ones</span> that

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

plastic <span class="marked id-unique-8639">tag</span> clipped to my <span class="marked id-unique-8643">shirt</span> with my name printed on

Your <span class="marked id-unique-8634">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-8633">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-8631">cells</span>
react to <span class="marked id-unique-8637">bacteria</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-8585">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8622">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-8595">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-8597">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-8591">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-8630">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-8607">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-8620">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-8609">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8586">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-8605">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8596">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-8628">connected</span>,
you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-8626">curve</span>, just on opposite <span class="marked id-unique-8618">ends</span>.

You see? It's <span class="marked id-unique-8627">curious</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-8590">Ted</span> did <span class="marked id-unique-8613">figure</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-8603">out - time</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8588">travel</span>. And when we get back, we gonna tell <span class="marked id-unique-8615">everyone</span>. How
it's <span class="marked id-unique-8599">possible</span>, how it's <span class="marked id-unique-8621">done</span>, what the <span class="marked id-unique-8625">dangers</span> are. But
then why <span class="marked id-unique-8614">fifty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8584">years</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-8612">future</span> when the <span class="marked id-unique-8594">spacecraft</span>

'<span class="marked id-unique-8587">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8617">entry</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8616">event'</span>? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. <span class="marked id-unique-8611">Hence</span> we die
down here. Just as a <span class="marked id-unique-8606">matter</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-8623">deductive</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8608">logic</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-8557">Yeah</span>, I like <span class="marked id-unique-8582">animals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8575">better</span> than people
<span class="marked id-unique-8562">sometimes</span>... <span class="marked id-unique-8570">Especially</span> dogs. Dogs are the <span class="marked id-unique-8581">best</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-8569">Every</span>

you in a <span class="marked id-unique-8556">year</span>. And the good <span class="marked id-unique-8561">thing</span> about dogs... is
they got <span class="marked id-unique-8579">different</span> dogs for <span class="marked id-unique-8579">different</span> people. Like <span class="marked id-unique-8583">pit</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8573">bulls</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-8578">dog</span> of dogs. <span class="marked id-unique-8583">Pit</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8580">bull</span> can be the right <span class="marked id-unique-8577">man's</span>

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-8601">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-8592">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-8624">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-8600">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-8602">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-8589">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8598">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-8593">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-8604">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-8636">became</span> nothing.

You see? It's curious. <span class="marked id-unique-8708">Ted</span> did figure it <span class="marked id-unique-8713">out - time</span>

then why fifty <span class="marked id-unique-8705">years</span> in the future when the <span class="marked id-unique-8709">spacecraft</span>

to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is

then why <span class="marked id-unique-8728">fifty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8715">years</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-8726">future</span> when the <span class="marked id-unique-8719">spacecraft</span>

'<span class="marked id-unique-8716">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8731">entry</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8730">event'</span>? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. <span class="marked id-unique-8725">Hence</span> we die
down here. Just as a <span class="marked id-unique-8722">matter</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-8734">deductive</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8723">logic</span>.
