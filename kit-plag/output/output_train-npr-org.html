Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-3195">crude <span class="marked id-unique-3196">oil</span> exploded</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3197">early Saturday</span> in a small Quebec town about 160 <span class="marked id-unique-3199">miles <span class="marked id-unique-3200">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a <span class="marked id-unique-3201">news
briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-3197">early Saturday</span> morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette <span class="marked id-unique-3197">early
Saturday</span> afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-3195">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-3198">half a
mile</span> outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3204">000 people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 <span class="marked id-unique-3202">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-3205">reported</span> missing</span>."

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-3217">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-3195">crude <span class="marked id-unique-3196">oil</span> exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3204">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 <span class="marked id-unique-3199">miles) <span class="marked id-unique-3200">east</span> of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-3197">early on Saturday</span>.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of <span class="marked id-unique-3202">people <span class="marked id-unique-3205">reported</span> missing</span>
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-3202">people had been <span class="marked id-unique-3205">reported</span> missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-3195">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-3209">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-3198">half a mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-3201">news briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-3207">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3208">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3209">Stephen</span> Harper</span> said in a <span class="marked id-unique-3210">statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-3211">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3212">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3213">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-3214">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3206">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-3215">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-3216">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3203">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3217">train</span> derailment</span>
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-3195">crude oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3204">000 people</span>,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a <span class="marked id-unique-3236">train derailment</span> in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-3233">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3234">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3235">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,

caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-3236">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-3220">least <span class="marked id-unique-3219">one</span> person</span>.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train
carrying <span class="marked id-unique-3222">crude oil</span> is still burning in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-3218">Quebec
town</span> of Lac-Megantic Saturday, July 6, 2013. (Surete

Smoke rises from railway <span class="marked id-unique-3226">cars that were carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3222">crude
oil</span> after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-3223">Lac Megantic</span>, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3231">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-3225">people <span class="marked id-unique-3232">reported</span> missing</span>
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-3227">train got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-3221">CTV News</span> Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-3228">73-car train</span> was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-3229">Witnesses reported</span> hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-3231">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter <span class="marked id-unique-3224">Saturday afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-3230">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-3222">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-3244">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-3241">least <span class="marked id-unique-3239">one</span> person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-3252">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-3254">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-3253">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3254">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-3245">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-3239">one <span class="marked id-unique-3238">person</span> had died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-3247">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-3255">reported</span> missing</span>.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-3247">people are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker <span class="marked id-unique-3249">rail cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-3240">center of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-3246">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-3240">center of town</span>, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-3244">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-3237">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-3243">town</span>, according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-3257">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3258">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3259">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-3260">statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-3261">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3262">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3263">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-3264">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-3256">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-3265">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-3266">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3248">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3267">train</span>
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-3269">hope <span class="marked id-unique-3251">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3270">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3268">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-3271">homes</span> safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed <span class="marked id-unique-3249">rail cars</span>
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-3242">tank <span class="marked id-unique-3250">cars</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3244">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-3454">freight train</span> pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-3455">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 <span class="marked id-unique-3456">miles <span class="marked id-unique-3457">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-3458">Joseph R. McGonigle</span> confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-3455">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the <span class="marked id-unique-3459">train got</span> loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3460">000 people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
<span class="marked id-unique-3461">60 people</span> have been reported missing."

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-3454">freight train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-3455">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-3461">60 people</span> were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3460">000 people</span> live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 <span class="marked id-unique-3456">miles <span class="marked id-unique-3457">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3460">000 people</span>.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-3462">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3463">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3464">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-3465">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-3458">Joseph McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the <span class="marked id-unique-3459">train got</span> released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Inferno In Quebec Town When <span class="marked id-unique-3468">Train Explodes</span>

At least <span class="marked id-unique-3466">one person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a

One dead, many missing as <span class="marked id-unique-3468">train explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
<span class="marked id-unique-3466">One person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-3469">freight train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3481">carrying oil</span> tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-3469">freight train</span>, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-3470">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-3472">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-3466">one person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-3482">town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3483">000</span> people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-3480">73-car train</span> was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-3488">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-3471">Joseph McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
<span class="marked id-unique-3467">Montreal Gazette</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-3473">conductor stopped</span> the train outside
town just before midnight and <span class="marked id-unique-3474">locked the brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-3475">train <span class="marked id-unique-3476">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3477">loose</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-3479">said</span> McGonigle</span>. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-3475">train got</span> released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-3472">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-3484">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3485">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3486">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-3487">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted

that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-3500">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-3497">least <span class="marked id-unique-3495">one</span> person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-3508">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-3510">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-3509">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3510">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-3501">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-3495">one <span class="marked id-unique-3494">person</span> had died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-3503">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-3511">reported</span> missing</span>.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-3503">people are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker <span class="marked id-unique-3505">rail cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-3496">center of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-3502">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-3496">center of town</span>, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-3500">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-3493">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-3499">town</span>, according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-3513">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3514">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3515">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-3516">statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-3517">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3518">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3519">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-3520">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-3512">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-3521">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-3522">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3504">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3523">train</span>
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-3525">hope <span class="marked id-unique-3507">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3526">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3524">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-3527">homes</span> safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed <span class="marked id-unique-3505">rail cars</span>
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-3498">tank <span class="marked id-unique-3506">cars</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3500">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-9145">crude <span class="marked id-unique-9146">oil</span> exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-9150">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-9147">east of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-9153">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-9149">half a mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-9148">news briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-9151">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9152">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-9154">statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-9155">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-9156">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9157">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-9158">families</span> and friends</span> of
those affected by this <span class="marked id-unique-9159">morning's tragic</span> train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-9145">crude oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Smoke rises from railway <span class="marked id-unique-9164">cars that were carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9161">crude
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-9167">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-9165">train got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-9167">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter <span class="marked id-unique-9163">Saturday afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-9166">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-9161">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least <span class="marked id-unique-9172">one person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-9173">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-9175">east
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a <span class="marked id-unique-9176">news
briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the <span class="marked id-unique-9177">center of town</span> in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail <span class="marked id-unique-9179">cars carrying</span>
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-9173">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-9180">73-car train</span> actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the <span class="marked id-unique-9179">cars
carrying</span> the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the <span class="marked id-unique-9182">town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-9183">000</span> people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 <span class="marked id-unique-9174">people have been reported</span> missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one <span class="marked id-unique-9181">person has died</span> in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-9184">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-9172">one person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-9180">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-9182">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-9183">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-9175">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-9172">one <span class="marked id-unique-9181">person</span> had died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-9174">people have been reported</span> missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-9174">people are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-9177">center of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-9176">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-9173">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-9184">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-9185">statement.

"Our thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-9186">prayers <span class="marked id-unique-9187">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-9188">families</span> and
friends</span> of those affected by this <span class="marked id-unique-9189">morning's <span class="marked id-unique-9178">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9190">train</span>
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-9191">hope <span class="marked id-unique-9192">evacuees</span> can</span> return to their <span class="marked id-unique-9193">homes safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-9179">cars carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9173">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-9327">freight train</span> pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-9328">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-9329">east
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it

spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-9328">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-9327">freight train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9328">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-9330">60 people</span> were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-9329">east
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-9331">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9332">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9333">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-9335">one person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a

One dead, many missing as <span class="marked id-unique-9334">train explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-9336">freight train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9344">carrying oil</span> tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-9336">freight train</span>, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-9337">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-9339">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-9335">one person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-9345">town
of about 6,000</span> people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-9343">73-car train</span> was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-9349">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the <span class="marked id-unique-9340">conductor stopped</span> the train outside
town just before midnight and <span class="marked id-unique-9338">locked the brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-9342">loose," said</span> McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-9341">train got</span> released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-9339">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-9346">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9347">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-9348">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-9346">prime minister</span> added: “We <span class="marked id-unique-9350">hope
evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9351">can return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-9352">homes safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-9355">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-9362">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-9365">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-9364">town of 6,000</span> people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-9357">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-9354">one <span class="marked id-unique-9363">person</span> had died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-9356">people are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-9359">center of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-9358">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-9359">center of town</span>, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-9353">Quebec town</span>, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-9366">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9367">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-9368">statement.

"Our thoughts</span> and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-9369">go out to the <span class="marked id-unique-9370">families</span> and
friends</span> of those affected by this morning's <span class="marked id-unique-9360">tragic <span class="marked id-unique-9371">train</span>
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-9372">hope evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9373">can return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-9374">homes safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-9361">cars carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9355">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-13739">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-13733">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-13738">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-13727">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started <span class="marked id-unique-13724">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-13720">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-13729">CBC</span> TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five <span class="marked id-unique-13746">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-13732">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-13721">overnight</span> driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by <span class="marked id-unique-13729">CBC</span>,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe <span class="marked id-unique-13744">McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-13737">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-13744">McGonigle</span> told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-13722">half</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-13719">mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars <span class="marked id-unique-13733">exploded</span>, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby <span class="marked id-unique-13747">homes</span> and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-13745">zone</span> was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-13730">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-13741">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13742">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-13735">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-13734">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-13736">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13726">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-13728">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-13743">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-13731">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-13725">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13723">tragic</span> train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-13740">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

oil after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-13768">Lac</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13767">Megantic</span>, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police <span class="marked id-unique-13748">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-13749">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-13752">might</span> still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-13759">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-13772">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-13771">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-13761">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-13754">CTV</span> News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-13758">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in <span class="marked id-unique-13750">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-13771">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-13757">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started <span class="marked id-unique-13751">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-13763">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-13770">According</span> to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-13762">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-13770">According</span> to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-13756">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-13755">afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-13772">nearby</span> Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-13753">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-13804">person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling <span class="marked id-unique-13806">tank</span> cars full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-13794">east</span>

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-13804">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-13790">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-13794">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-13804">person</span> had died. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-13807">say</span> how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-13779">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-13807">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-13785">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-13783">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-13798">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-13787">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-13786">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-13796">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-13773">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-13789">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-13795">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-13805">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-13801">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13802">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13800">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-13792">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-13791">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-13793">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13780">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-13781">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-13803">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-13784">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-13778">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13775">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-13788">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13782">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-13777">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-13776">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-13797">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-13805">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-13806">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each <span class="marked id-unique-13806">tank</span>
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-13774">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-13799">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-13906">freight</span> train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-13922">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13897">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-13907">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-13908">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-13917">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-13914">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-13902">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-13898">six</span>
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-13895">Huge</span> clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-13924">zone</span> as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-13896">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-13915">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-13923">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13911">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-13920">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13921">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13919">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-13910">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-13909">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-13912">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-13901">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-13900">overnight</span> driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-13913">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-13905">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13899">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13893">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-13894">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-13904">left</span> a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-13916">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-13918">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-13903">half</span> of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-13927">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-13957">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-13961">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-13961">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
<span class="marked id-unique-13929">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-13937">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-13962">afternoon</span> police
<span class="marked id-unique-13951">confirmed</span> the death of one <span class="marked id-unique-13957">person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-13960">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-13946">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-13935">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-13960">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-13948">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the <span class="marked id-unique-13952">accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-13965">Rail</span> World, the parent <span class="marked id-unique-13964">company</span> of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-13942">73-car</span> train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-13958">zone</span>: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-13934">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-13956">Gazette</span> the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-13925">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-13955">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-13926">locked</span> the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then <span class="marked id-unique-13928">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-13953">Sometime</span> after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-13939">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-13932">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-13933">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, <span class="marked id-unique-13951">confirmed</span> last night that it had received
a call <span class="marked id-unique-13953">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-13955">midnight</span> about a <span class="marked id-unique-13959">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-13962">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-13949">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-13941">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-13954">small</span> village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-13930">160</span> firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-13950">Stephen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13963">Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-13943">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-13945">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-13944">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-13947">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-13940">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-13938">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-13936">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-13931">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-13997">person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-13997">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-13983">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-13987">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-13997">person</span> had died. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-14000">say</span> how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-13972">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-14000">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-13978">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-13976">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-13991">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-13980">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-13979">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-13989">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-13966">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-13982">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-13988">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-13998">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-13994">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13995">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13993">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-13985">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-13984">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-13986">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13973">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-13974">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-13996">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-13977">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-13971">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13968">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-13981">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-13975">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-13970">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-13969">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-13990">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-13998">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-13999">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each <span class="marked id-unique-13999">tank</span>
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-13967">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-13992">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train <span class="marked id-unique-18829">derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-18819">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-18824">carrying</span> light crude <span class="marked id-unique-18823">oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18799">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-18821">one</span> and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-18818">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-18809">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-18830">cars</span> reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started <span class="marked id-unique-18806">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have <span class="marked id-unique-18825">reported</span> up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-18821">one</span> death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people <span class="marked id-unique-18825">reported</span> missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-18825">reported</span> missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses <span class="marked id-unique-18825">reported</span> that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-18801">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to <span class="marked id-unique-18821">one</span> of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-18798">CBC</span> TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five <span class="marked id-unique-18822">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 <span class="marked id-unique-18830">cars</span> filled with light crude <span class="marked id-unique-18823">oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-18813">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-18802">overnight</span> driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by <span class="marked id-unique-18798">CBC</span>,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-18830">cars</span> filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe <span class="marked id-unique-18804">McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-18817">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-18804">McGonigle</span> told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-18803">half</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-18800">mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-18830">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18799">exploded</span>, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-18832">nearby</span> homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-18831">zone</span> was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-18811">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-18826">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18827">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-18815">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-18814">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-18816">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18808">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-18810">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-18828">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-18812">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-18807">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18805">tragic</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-18829">derailment</span>
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-18832">nearby</span>
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-18820">added</span>.

The train was <span class="marked id-unique-18824">carrying</span> the crude <span class="marked id-unique-18823">oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Harper to visit Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-18851">town</span> devastated by train derailment

<span class="marked id-unique-18858">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18859">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18857">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-18860">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-18853">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train
carrying crude <span class="marked id-unique-18864">oil</span> is still burning in the eastern Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-18851">town</span> of Lac-Megantic Saturday, July 6, 2013. (Surete

Smoke rises from railway <span class="marked id-unique-18842">cars</span> that were carrying crude
<span class="marked id-unique-18864">oil</span> after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-18844">Lac</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18843">Megantic</span>, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police <span class="marked id-unique-18834">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a <span class="marked id-unique-18848">news</span> conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-18863">reported</span> missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-18835">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the <span class="marked id-unique-18851">town</span> due to fears that five of the tankers <span class="marked id-unique-18842">cars</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-18839">might</span> still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-18849">happened</span> During Saturday's <span class="marked id-unique-18848">news</span> conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-18862">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, <span class="marked id-unique-18861">says</span> the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-18850">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-18854">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-18833">CTV</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18848">News</span> Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-18847">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in <span class="marked id-unique-18836">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
<span class="marked id-unique-18851">town</span> centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-18850">loose</span>" in the <span class="marked id-unique-18852">early</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18846">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started <span class="marked id-unique-18838">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-18856">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too <span class="marked id-unique-18852">early</span>
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-18837">According</span> to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-18855">Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18863">reported</span> hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-18837">According</span> to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-18845">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-18841">afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-18851">town</span>
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude <span class="marked id-unique-18864">oil</span> spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-18862">nearby</span> Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-18840">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's <span class="marked id-unique-18909">center</span> and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-18891">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18867">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
<span class="marked id-unique-18907">witnesses</span> said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-18885">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-18889">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-18908">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-18891">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18867">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-18902">died</span>. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-18901">say</span> how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-18874">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-18869">reported</span> missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-18901">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in <span class="marked id-unique-18869">reported</span> love ones missing, some
people are <span class="marked id-unique-18869">reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-18904">derailment</span> caused several tanker rail <span class="marked id-unique-18905">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-18906">first</span> explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-18880">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-18909">center</span> of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-18878">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-18909">center</span> of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-18907">Witnesses</span> said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-18894">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous <span class="marked id-unique-18903">crash</span> and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-18882">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-18881">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the <span class="marked id-unique-18903">crash</span>, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-18906">first</span> explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-18892">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-18891">one</span> akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-18865">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 <span class="marked id-unique-18905">cars</span> were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-18884">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-18890">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-18868">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-18898">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18899">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18897">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-18887">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-18886">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-18888">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18875">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-18876">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-18900">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-18879">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-18873">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18870">tragic</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-18904">derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-18883">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18877">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-18872">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-18871">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-18893">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-18868">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail <span class="marked id-unique-18905">cars</span>
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-18895">tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18905">cars</span> carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each <span class="marked id-unique-18895">tank</span>
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-18866">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-18896">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-19019">east</span>

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,

the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-19008">half</span> a
mile outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-19020">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-19011">freight</span> train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-19032">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19002">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-19012">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-19013">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-19024">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-19019">east</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-19029">Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-19007">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-19003">six</span>
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-19000">Huge</span> clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. <span class="marked id-unique-19021">One</span> carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-19034">zone</span> as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-19031">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-19001">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right <span class="marked id-unique-19030">now</span> because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19020">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-19033">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19016">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-19027">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19028">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19026">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-19015">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-19014">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19017">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-19029">Montreal</span>, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-19006">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-19005">overnight</span> driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-19018">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-19010">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19004">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-18998">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-18999">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-19009">left</span> a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-19022">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
<span class="marked id-unique-19023">exploded</span>. In just <span class="marked id-unique-19021">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-19021">one</span> of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-19025">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right <span class="marked id-unique-19030">now</span> there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-19008">half</span> of Canada.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-19037">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-19047">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-19067">freight</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-19072">carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19069">oil</span> tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-19067">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude <span class="marked id-unique-19069">oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
<span class="marked id-unique-19039">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-19050">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-19068">afternoon</span> police
<span class="marked id-unique-19041">confirmed</span> the death of one <span class="marked id-unique-19047">person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying <span class="marked id-unique-19071">authorities</span> "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-19066">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-19063">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-19046">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-19066">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-19075">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was <span class="marked id-unique-19073">outside</span> his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the <span class="marked id-unique-19078">accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-19079">Montreal</span>,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-19059">73-car</span> train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-19082">zone</span>: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-19045">Joseph</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19070">McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
<span class="marked id-unique-19079">Montreal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19057">Gazette</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19048">conductor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19035">stopped</span> the train <span class="marked id-unique-19073">outside</span>
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-19056">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19036">locked</span> the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then <span class="marked id-unique-19038">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-19054">Sometime</span> after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-19052">loose</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-19070">McGonigle</span>. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the <span class="marked id-unique-19048">conductor</span> had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The <span class="marked id-unique-19048">conductor</span>,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-19080">happened</span>, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-19070">McGonigle</span> told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-19080">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-19043">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-19044">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, <span class="marked id-unique-19041">confirmed</span> last night that it had received
a call <span class="marked id-unique-19054">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-19056">midnight</span> about a <span class="marked id-unique-19065">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-19068">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-19076">trains</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19072">carrying</span>
that much <span class="marked id-unique-19069">oil</span> to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I <span class="marked id-unique-19074">hope</span> they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
<span class="marked id-unique-19071">authorities</span>, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-19081">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-19058">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-19055">small</span> village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the <span class="marked id-unique-19071">authorities</span> want us to." Beauchesne said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-19040">160</span> firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-19077">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-19060">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19062">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-19061">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-19064">added</span>: “We <span class="marked id-unique-19074">hope</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19053">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-19051">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-19049">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-19042">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least <span class="marked id-unique-19109">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19085">person</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-19120">died</span>, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling <span class="marked id-unique-19113">tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19123">cars</span> full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-19107">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities <span class="marked id-unique-19126">confirmed</span> the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the <span class="marked id-unique-19121">crash</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19083">site</span> as a 'war zone.' " In a news

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's <span class="marked id-unique-19127">center</span> and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-19109">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19085">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
<span class="marked id-unique-19125">witnesses</span> said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-19103">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-19107">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-19126">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-19109">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19085">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-19120">died</span>. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-19119">say</span> how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-19092">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-19087">reported</span> missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-19119">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in <span class="marked id-unique-19087">reported</span> love ones missing, some
people are <span class="marked id-unique-19087">reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-19122">derailment</span> caused several tanker rail <span class="marked id-unique-19123">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-19124">first</span> explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-19098">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-19127">center</span> of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-19096">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-19127">center</span> of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-19125">Witnesses</span> said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-19112">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous <span class="marked id-unique-19121">crash</span> and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-19100">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-19099">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the <span class="marked id-unique-19121">crash</span>, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-19124">first</span> explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-19110">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-19109">one</span> akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-19083">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 <span class="marked id-unique-19123">cars</span> were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-19102">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19108">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-19086">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-19116">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19117">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19115">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-19105">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-19104">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19106">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19093">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-19094">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-19118">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-19097">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-19091">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19088">tragic</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-19122">derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-19101">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19095">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-19090">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-19089">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-19111">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-19086">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail <span class="marked id-unique-19123">cars</span>
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-19113">tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19123">cars</span> carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each <span class="marked id-unique-19113">tank</span>
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-19084">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-19114">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-23694">full</span> of crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-23700">exploded</span>
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-23705">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the <span class="marked id-unique-23706">crash</span> site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-23697">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and <span class="marked id-unique-23700">exploded</span> in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the <span class="marked id-unique-23710">locomotive</span>.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The <span class="marked id-unique-23710">locomotive</span>
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-23689">half</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-23686">mile</span> outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-23707">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on <span class="marked id-unique-23691">rolling</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-23696">CBC</span> News says
that "witnesses reported between <span class="marked id-unique-23699">four</span> and six explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-23688">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-23704">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-23706">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-23700">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-23705">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-23694">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started <span class="marked id-unique-23691">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-23687">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-23696">CBC</span> TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five <span class="marked id-unique-23710">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-23699">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-23688">overnight</span> driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by <span class="marked id-unique-23696">CBC</span>,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-23704">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-23689">half</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-23686">mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars <span class="marked id-unique-23700">exploded</span>, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-23697">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-23708">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23709">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-23702">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-23701">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-23703">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23693">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-23695">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-23711">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-23698">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-23692">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23690">tragic</span> train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-23707">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  <span class="marked id-unique-23718">CTV</span> National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-23731">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23732">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23730">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-23726">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police <span class="marked id-unique-23712">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-23713">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-23716">might</span> still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-23725">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-23733">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-23727">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-23718">CTV</span> News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-23722">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in <span class="marked id-unique-23714">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-23733">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-23721">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started <span class="marked id-unique-23715">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-23729">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-23728">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-23720">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-23719">afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-23717">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-23765">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-23751">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-23755">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-23765">person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-23740">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-23746">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-23744">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-23759">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-23748">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-23747">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-23757">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-23734">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-23750">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-23756">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-23766">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-23762">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23763">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23761">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-23753">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-23752">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-23754">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23741">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-23742">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-23764">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-23745">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-23739">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23736">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-23749">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23743">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-23738">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-23737">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-23758">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-23766">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-23735">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-23760">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-23847">freight</span> train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-23838">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-23848">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-23849">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-23858">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-23855">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-23843">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-23839">six</span>
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-23836">Huge</span> clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-23837">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-23856">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can <span class="marked id-unique-23852">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-23861">Prime</span> Minister <span class="marked id-unique-23860">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-23851">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-23850">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-23853">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-23842">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-23841">overnight</span> driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-23854">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-23846">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23840">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23834">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-23835">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-23845">left</span> a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-23857">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-23859">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-23844">half</span> of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-23864">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-23894">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-23894">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
<span class="marked id-unique-23866">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-23874">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-23896">afternoon</span> police
<span class="marked id-unique-23895">confirmed</span> the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-23893">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-23887">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-23872">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-23893">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-23889">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the <span class="marked id-unique-23897">accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-23879">73-car</span> train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-23871">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-23886">Gazette</span> the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-23862">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-23885">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-23863">locked</span> the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then <span class="marked id-unique-23865">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-23882">Sometime</span> after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-23876">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-23869">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-23870">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, <span class="marked id-unique-23895">confirmed</span> last night that it had received
a call <span class="marked id-unique-23882">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-23885">midnight</span> about a <span class="marked id-unique-23892">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-23896">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-23890">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-23878">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-23883">small</span> village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-23867">160</span> firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-23891">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-23880">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-23884">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-23881">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-23888">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-23877">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-23875">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-23873">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-23868">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-23929">person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-23919">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash <span class="marked id-unique-23898">site</span> as a 'war zone.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-23908">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing <span class="marked id-unique-23904">might</span> have been
out of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-23930">According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-23912">morning</span> was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that <span class="marked id-unique-23910">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-23924">train's</span> conductor stopped in <span class="marked id-unique-23923">nearby</span> Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of <span class="marked id-unique-23899">liters</span> of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-23915">73-car</span> train actually detached half a
mile <span class="marked id-unique-23911">outside</span> of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-23920">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept <span class="marked id-unique-23921">right</span> on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between <span class="marked id-unique-23914">four</span> and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but <span class="marked id-unique-23930">according</span> to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-23929">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-23915">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-23919">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-23929">person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-23904">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-23910">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-23908">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-23923">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-23912">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-23911">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-23921">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-23898">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-23914">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-23920">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-23930">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-23926">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23927">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23925">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-23917">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-23916">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-23918">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23905">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-23906">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-23928">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-23909">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-23903">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23900">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-23913">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23907">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-23902">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-23901">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-23922">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-23930">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-23899">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-23924">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.
