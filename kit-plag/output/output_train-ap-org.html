<span class="marked id-unique-5445">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec</span> (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-5449">24 hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-5450">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-5451">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5452">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5453">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-5458">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-5460">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-5461">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-5462">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-5455">lakeside town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-5462">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-5446">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-5464">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-5465">confirmed that
one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-5466">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-5467">reported</span> missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-5469">Guy Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-5458">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-5471">people who will
be found</span> deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-5474">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-5476">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-5466">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-5458">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-5479">town <span class="marked id-unique-5480">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5481">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-5482">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5484">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-5472">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-5485">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5486">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-5448">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-5487">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5488">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5489">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5490">Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5454">told</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-5491">televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5447">news</span> briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-5450">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-5495">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-5496">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-5497">said the
train</span> had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-5498">brakes were properly</span> applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-5497">said the
train</span> was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-5494">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-5468">like a <span class="marked id-unique-5501">movie</span>," said</span> Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-5500">Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-5503">scripted - but</span> this was live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-5473">said.

<span class="marked id-unique-5505">Environment</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5478">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5506">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5502">Christian</span> Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-5493">73 <span class="marked id-unique-5444">cars</span> were filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-5453">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-5508">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-5509">mobile <span class="marked id-unique-5510">laboratory</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-5477">set</span> up to
<span class="marked id-unique-5504">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5459">quality</span> of the air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-5443">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-5492">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5511">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-5512">statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-5456">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5513">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5514">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-5515">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-5507">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-5516">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-5517">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5518">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5483">train</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5519">derailment</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5520">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5499">fires</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-5445">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec</span>,"
<span class="marked id-unique-5475">Harper said</span>.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The <span class="marked id-unique-5521">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-5495">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-5496">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-5522">500 miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-5523">track <span class="marked id-unique-5457">serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5463">Maine</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5524">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5525">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-5526">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-5451">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact <span class="marked id-unique-5470">across the
border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-5452">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-5453">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5495">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-5496">Maine</span> and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-5460">death toll</span> set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-5483">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-5458">Police have said</span> they expect more <span class="marked id-unique-5471">people to be found</span> dead
after a <span class="marked id-unique-5450">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-5451">train</span> carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-5453">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-5461">black smoke</span> into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-5462">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-5446">155 miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-5464">east of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-5476">missing people</span>.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials <span class="marked id-unique-5497">said the train</span> had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'<span class="marked id-unique-5468">Like a movie'</span> The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-5465">confirmed one</span> death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-5469">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-5474">number of <span class="marked id-unique-5466">people</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5467">reported</span> missing</span>
will be greater than the final <span class="marked id-unique-5460">death toll</span>."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-5466">people had been <span class="marked id-unique-5467">reported</span> missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than <span class="marked id-unique-5449">24 hours</span>.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-5470">across the border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than <span class="marked id-unique-5449">24 hours</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5494">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-5468">like a <span class="marked id-unique-5501">movie</span>," he said</span>, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "<span class="marked id-unique-5500">Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-5503">scripted -
but</span> this was live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5495">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-5496">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-5493">73 <span class="marked id-unique-5444">cars</span> filled</span> with light <span class="marked id-unique-5453">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-5498">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5444">cars filled</span> with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-5511">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

<span class="marked id-unique-5546">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-5547">provincial</span> police</span> Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-5531">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-5549">many"
<span class="marked id-unique-5550">people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-5551">reported</span> missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-5552">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-5553">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-5546">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-5547">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5538">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-5555">expect <span class="marked id-unique-5556">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-5557">people</span> who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-5558">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5559">deceased</span> unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-5560">give any estimate</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5561">people unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-5562">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-5563">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-5550">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-5535">popular area</span> packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-5538">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-5568">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-5569">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5572">president and <span class="marked id-unique-5573">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5574">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5576">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5564">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-5577">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5571">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5578">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5579">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-5580">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5582">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-5583">train</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-5584">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5585">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-5586">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-5567">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5587">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5548">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-5588">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-5589">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-5590">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5575">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5565">Edward Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-5591">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-5592">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-5587">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5548">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-5582">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-5583">train</span> was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-5593">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-5529">finished</span> his run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-5595">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-5536">early morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local <span class="marked id-unique-5542">fire <span class="marked id-unique-5554">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5597">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5594">Lauzon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5581">described</span> the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-5581">described the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-5533">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-5598">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-5599">Quebec town</span>, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-5527">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-5570">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5600">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-5566">train
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-5596">assistance
requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-5578">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-5579">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-5544">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-5601">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5602">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-5603">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-5530">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-5604">cars <span class="marked id-unique-5532">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5533">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5578">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-5579">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5580">Atlantic</span> Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-5532">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes

into the sky.

that the <span class="marked id-unique-5539">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do <span class="marked id-unique-5555">expect
<span class="marked id-unique-5556">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-5557">people</span> who will be <span class="marked id-unique-5558">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5559">deceased</span>,
unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-5552">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-5553">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-5550">people <span class="marked id-unique-5551">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5563">missing</span>
than people</span> actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-5560">give an estimate</span> to how <span class="marked id-unique-5549">many <span class="marked id-unique-5561">people</span> were unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-5596">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-5542">fire <span class="marked id-unique-5554">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5597">Denis</span> Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-5578">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-5579">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-5580">Atlantic</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-5582">said the <span class="marked id-unique-5583">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-5584">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5585">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-5586">brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-5567">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5587">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5548">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-5588">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-5589">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5590">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5575">away</span>," he said</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-5591">think the <span class="marked id-unique-5592">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-5587">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5548">applied</span> on this train</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-5582">said the <span class="marked id-unique-5583">train</span> was parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-5593">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-5529">finished</span> his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-5541">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-5583">train</span> was parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-5578">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-5579">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5582">said the
train</span> "came loose" in the <span class="marked id-unique-5536">early morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-5538">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-5544">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-5601">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-5602">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5603">New</span> Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone <span class="marked id-unique-5594">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-5581">described</span> the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-5535">popular area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-5543">000 people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-5562">number of
people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-5545">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-5533">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-5598">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-5568">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-5569">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-6267">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-6265">least <span class="marked id-unique-6266">one</span> person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-6269">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-6270">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-6271">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-6270">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-6272">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-6266">one <span class="marked id-unique-6273">person</span> had died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-6274">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-6275">reported</span> missing</span>.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-6274">people are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker <span class="marked id-unique-6277">rail cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-6278">center of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-6264">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-6278">center of town</span>, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-6267">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-6282">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-6283">town</span>, according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-6263">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-6280">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6284">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-6285">statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-6268">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-6286">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6287">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-6288">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-6281">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-6289">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-6290">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6291">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6279">train</span>
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-6293">hope <span class="marked id-unique-6276">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6294">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6295">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-6292">homes</span> safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed <span class="marked id-unique-6277">rail cars</span>
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-6296">tank <span class="marked id-unique-6297">cars</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6267">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In <span class="marked id-unique-6282">Quebec Town</span> When Train Explodes

At <span class="marked id-unique-6265">least <span class="marked id-unique-6266">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6273">person</span> has died</span>, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling <span class="marked id-unique-6296">tank cars</span> full of <span class="marked id-unique-6267">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small <span class="marked id-unique-6282">Quebec town</span> about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-6272">east
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a <span class="marked id-unique-6264">news
briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of <span class="marked id-unique-6283">town.

According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the <span class="marked id-unique-6278">center of town</span> in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the <span class="marked id-unique-6277">rail <span class="marked id-unique-6297">cars</span> carrying</span>
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-6267">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-6269">73-car train</span> actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the <span class="marked id-unique-6297">cars
carrying</span> the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the <span class="marked id-unique-6271">town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-6270">000</span> people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 <span class="marked id-unique-6274">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-6275">reported</span> missing</span>."

website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-6317">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-6370">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6371">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-6372">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-6303">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-6373">border. In Maine</span>, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-6304">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-6340">Montreal, Maine</span> and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-6299">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-6303">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-6304">crude <span class="marked id-unique-6306">oil</span> derailed</span> at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-6302">runaway train</span> with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-6299">Lac-Megantic
in Quebec</span> before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-6315">Witnesses said</span> the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-6316">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-6307">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-6373">border with Maine</span> and about <span class="marked id-unique-6300">155 miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6318">east
of Montreal</span>.

About <span class="marked id-unique-6349">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-6348">several hours</span>
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-6316">000 people</span>.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-6312">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-6337">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-6338">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your <span class="marked id-unique-6330">town <span class="marked id-unique-6331">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6332">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6333">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6334">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-6325">asking</span> ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-6335">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-6336">get</span> through this event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-6321">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-6298">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-6339">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6369">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-6309">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-6340">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-6317">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-6371">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-6372">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-6301">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-6308">resident <span class="marked id-unique-6326">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6319">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6341">described</span> the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-6324">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-6359">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6311">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6327">everything</span> that was
there is gone</span>."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-6344">Bernard Demers</span>, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-6356">like an <span class="marked id-unique-6357">atomic</span> bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-6320">hot. <span class="marked id-unique-6351">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-6355">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-6366">Chaudiere</span>
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-6360">Environment <span class="marked id-unique-6328">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6361">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6352">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6342">Blanchette</span> said</span>
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-6367">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-6354">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-6313">quality</span> of
the air</span>.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-6322">spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-6305">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-6362">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-6363">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6323">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-6364">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-6310">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6365">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6350">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-6353">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-6358">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-6346">water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-6366">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-6368">Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-6329">rescue</span> workers</span> had to be called in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-6343">municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-6345">including</span> Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-6314">help <span class="marked id-unique-6347">deal</span> with the disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-6373">border with <span class="marked id-unique-6317">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-6370">Vermont</span>. Quebec</span> is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-6375">late
Saturday</span> nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-6380">train carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6383">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-6381">one person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-6388">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-6389">intense <span class="marked id-unique-6390">heat</span> of towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-6387">night sky</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-6392">witnesses said</span>. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-6393">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-6394">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-6376">train</span> derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-6396">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-6384">lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-6398">town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-6396">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-6401">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-6402">provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6403">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6404">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-6405">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-6381">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

<span class="marked id-unique-6407">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-6408">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-6401">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-6402">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6388">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-6409">people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-6412">found</span> deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-6415">missing, some
people</span> are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-6388">Police said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-6416">first explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-6379">cause of the accident</span> was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-6421">railway's operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-6424">Rail World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-6427">parent
<span class="marked id-unique-6422">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-6428">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6429">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-6430">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6431">Railway</span>, said</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-6432">train had been <span class="marked id-unique-6433">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6434">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-6435">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-6419">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6436">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6406">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-6437">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-6438">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-6439">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6425">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6417">Edward <span class="marked id-unique-6440">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-6442">think</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-6444">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-6436">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6406">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-6432">train was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-6445">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-6378">finished</span> his run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-6447">We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-6426">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6413">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6382">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-6448">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6441">years</span>,"
he said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "<span class="marked id-unique-6449">Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-6395">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6450">we've</span>
blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-6453">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-6392">Witnesses said</span> the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-6386">early morning</span> sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-6423">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-6416">first explosion</span> went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," <span class="marked id-unique-6460">said Theberge</span>, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-6462">burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-6459">right</span> arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a <span class="marked id-unique-6463">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-6464">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6465">like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-6466">bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-6377">lot</span> of people</span> there," said <span class="marked id-unique-6443">Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-6452">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-6468">owns</span> a restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-6469">big
<span class="marked id-unique-6470">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-6471">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-6391">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-6455">population</span>."

Demers</span>, who fled his home, said the <span class="marked id-unique-6458">explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-6472">like</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-6473">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-6400">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-6461">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-6383">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-6374">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-6420">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6475">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-6385">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-6418">train
<span class="marked id-unique-6476">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-6478">hope <span class="marked id-unique-6411">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6479">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6480">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-6477">homes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6481">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-6414">quickly</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-6482">people</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-6483">Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-6467">surrounding</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6446">areas</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6484">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6451">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6485">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-6486">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-6410">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-6487">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-6399">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-6456">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-6474">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-6454">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6457">requested</span> by the province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-6428">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-6429">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-6488">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6397">Maine, Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6489">Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-6490">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-6380">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-6383">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-6428">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-6429">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-6430">Atlantic</span> Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
<span class="marked id-unique-6381">One person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-6380">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-6423">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-6383">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-6384">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," <span class="marked id-unique-6460">said Theberge</span>, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-6462">burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-6459">right</span> arm</span>.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-6381">one person</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-6476">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-6407">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-6408">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-6401">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-6402">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-6409">people <span class="marked id-unique-6412">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-6453">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-6398">town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-6396">000</span> people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-6389">intense <span class="marked id-unique-6390">heat</span>
as the towering</span> flames lit up the <span class="marked id-unique-6387">night sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-6415">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-6416">first explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-6392">Witnesses said</span>
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-6375">Late Saturday</span> firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-6379">cause of the accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-6421">railway's operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-6417">Edward Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-6424">Rail World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-6427">parent <span class="marked id-unique-6422">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-6428">Montreal</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-6429">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-6430">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6431">Railway</span>, said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-6394">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-6432">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-6433">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-6434">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-6445">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-6378">finished</span>
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-6435">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-6419">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6436">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6406">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-6437">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-6438">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-6439">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6425">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6440">Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-6442">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-6444">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-6436">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6406">applied</span> on this train</span>." "<span class="marked id-unique-6447">We've had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-6426">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6413">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6382">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-6448">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6441">years</span>," he said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-6449">Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-6395">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6450">we've</span> blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-6418">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-6488">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6489">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-6490">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-6397">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-6402">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-6388">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-6376">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-6393">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-6402">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-6403">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6404">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-6405">Michel</span> Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-6443">Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-6452">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-6468">owns</span> a restaurant</span> in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-6386">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-6469">big <span class="marked id-unique-6458">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6472">like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-6473">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-6400">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-6461">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a <span class="marked id-unique-6463">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-6464">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6465">like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-6466">bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-6377">lot</span> of people</span> there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-6469">big <span class="marked id-unique-6470">explosion</span>. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-6471">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-6391">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-6455">population</span>."
Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-6374">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-6420">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6475">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-6385">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-6374">prime minister</span> added: “We <span class="marked id-unique-6478">hope
<span class="marked id-unique-6411">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6479">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6480">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-6477">homes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6481">safely</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-6414">quickly</span>.

the province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-10729">24 hours</span> after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-10725">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-10724">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-10732">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-10734">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-10735">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-10731">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-10726">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-10736">reported missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10738">Guy Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-10732">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-10740">people who will
be found</span> deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-10743">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-10744">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-10732">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-10746">almost <span class="marked id-unique-10747">destroyed</span>,
you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-10741">asking ourselves how we
are going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-10728">event," an emotional</span> Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-10748">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10723">told a televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10727">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-10751">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-10752">brakes were properly</span> applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-10750">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-10737">like a movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-10758">said.

<span class="marked id-unique-10759">Environment</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10745">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10760">spokesman</span> Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-10749">73 cars</span> were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-10724">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-10761">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-10762">mobile <span class="marked id-unique-10763">laboratory</span> had been set</span> up to
<span class="marked id-unique-10757">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-10733">quality</span> of the air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-10764">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10739">Stephen Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-10730">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the <span class="marked id-unique-10765">families and
friends</span> of those affected by this <span class="marked id-unique-10766">morning's tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10767">train
<span class="marked id-unique-10755">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10753">fires in <span class="marked id-unique-10754">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec</span>,"
<span class="marked id-unique-10742">Harper said</span>.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The <span class="marked id-unique-10768">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-10769">Maine & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-10770">500 miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-10756">track serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-10771">Vermont, Quebec</span> and
New Brunswick.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-10772">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-10725">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-10724">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10751">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-10769">Maine</span> and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-10734">death toll</span> set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-10767">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-10732">Police have said</span> they expect more <span class="marked id-unique-10740">people to be found</span> dead
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-10772">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-10724">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-10735">black smoke</span> into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-10731">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-10726">155 miles</span>) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-10743">missing people</span>.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'<span class="marked id-unique-10737">Like a movie'</span> The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-10738">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the number of <span class="marked id-unique-10744">people reported</span> missing
will be greater than the final <span class="marked id-unique-10734">death toll</span>."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-10744">people had been <span class="marked id-unique-10736">reported</span> missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than <span class="marked id-unique-10729">24 hours</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10750">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-10737">like a movie</span>," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10751">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-10749">73 cars</span> filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-10752">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-10739">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-10746">almost <span class="marked id-unique-10747">destroyed</span>,
you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-10741">asking ourselves how we

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-10775">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-10773">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-10777">eastern Quebec</span>, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-10781">killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-10776">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10774">one</span> person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10782">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-10783">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-10784">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-10780">000 people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-10785">Quebec provincial</span> police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-10774">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-10787">many"
people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-10788">reported missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-10789">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10790">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-10785">Quebec provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10782">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-10792">expect we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-10793">people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-10794">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10795">deceased</span> unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-10796">people are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-10778">popular area</span> packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-10782">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10797">president and <span class="marked id-unique-10798">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-10800">Rail</span> World</span> Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-10801">Montreal, Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-10802">Atlantic Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10803">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-10804">train</span> had been parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10805">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-10806">brakes aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10807">properly <span class="marked id-unique-10786">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-10808">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-10809">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10799">away</span>," said</span> Edward Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-10810">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-10811">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-10807">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10786">applied</span> on this train</span>."

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and

the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to

the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-10816">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-10791">chief <span class="marked id-unique-10817">Denis</span> Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-10821">Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-10802">Atlantic</span>
Railway</span> Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-10797">President and <span class="marked id-unique-10798">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-10800">Rail</span> World</span> Inc., the parent company
of <span class="marked id-unique-10801">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-10821">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, Edward Burkhardt
<span class="marked id-unique-10803">said the <span class="marked id-unique-10804">train</span> was parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10805">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-10806">brakes
aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10807">properly <span class="marked id-unique-10786">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-10808">going to <span class="marked id-unique-10809">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10799">away</span>," he said</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-10810">think the <span class="marked id-unique-10811">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-10807">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10786">applied</span> on this train</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-10803">said the train</span> was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-10812">finished his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-10784">73-car train</span> was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-10801">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-10821">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the <span class="marked id-unique-10779">early morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-10782">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-10818">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-10822">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-10815">Quebec</span> and New</span> Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone <span class="marked id-unique-10813">Lauzon described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-10778">popular area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-10829">AP) - <span class="marked id-unique-10838">Fires</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10841">continued</span> burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-10833">nearly <span class="marked id-unique-10845">24</span> hours</span> after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-10832">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-10828">crude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10848">oil</span> derailed</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-10849">eastern <span class="marked id-unique-10853">Quebec</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10854">igniting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10860">explosions</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-10862">fires</span> that destroyed</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-10863">town's <span class="marked id-unique-10865">center</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10869">killed</span> at
<span class="marked id-unique-10844">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10831">one</span> person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10870">Police <span class="marked id-unique-10876">said</span> they expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions <span class="marked id-unique-10840">sent residents</span> of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-10881">intense <span class="marked id-unique-10882">heat</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-10859">towering</span>
fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-10836">red glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-10883">illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-10868">night</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10885">sky</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-10886">witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10856">said</span>. Flames</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10887">billowing <span class="marked id-unique-10888">black</span> smoke</span> could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-10879">long after the 73-car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10839">train derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 <span class="marked id-unique-10878">people were forced</span> from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-10864">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-10834">155 <span class="marked id-unique-10892">miles</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-10831">one person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-10877">died. He <span class="marked id-unique-10900">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-10903">say</span> how <span class="marked id-unique-10904">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10906">others</span>
might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-10858">dead, but <span class="marked id-unique-10907">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10910">authorities</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-10835">told</span> "<span class="marked id-unique-10911">many</span>"
people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-10912">reported missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-10914">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10915">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-10919">spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-10897">Quebec</span> provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10870">police, <span class="marked id-unique-10921">said</span>: "I don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10924">want to <span class="marked id-unique-10867">get</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-10925">numbers</span>, what I

be found <span class="marked id-unique-10931">deceased <span class="marked id-unique-10933">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-10873">Lapointe</span> refused</span> to give any estimate of people <span class="marked id-unique-10935">unaccounted
for because <span class="marked id-unique-10936">police</span> were having <span class="marked id-unique-10938">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10939">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-10940">fixed</span> number</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-10917">People are calling</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-10943">reported love</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-10949">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-10950">people</span> are reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10953">two, three</span> times missing by different
members of the <span class="marked id-unique-10958">family," he <span class="marked id-unique-10852">said</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10959">derailment</span> caused</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10961">several tanker</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10945">rail <span class="marked id-unique-10963">cars</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-10965">explode</span>
in the <span class="marked id-unique-10966">downtown</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-10857">popular</span> area</span> packed with <span class="marked id-unique-10968">bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-10969">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10830">bustles</span> on summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10971">weekend nights</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-10870">Police <span class="marked id-unique-10972">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10973">first</span> explosion</span> tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-10975">town
shortly</span> after 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-10977">local time</span>. The fire then spread to
<span class="marked id-unique-10978">several homes</span>.

"When you see the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-10981">destroyed,
you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-10934">asking ourselves how we
are going</span> to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette <span class="marked id-unique-10983">Roy-Laroche <span class="marked id-unique-10827">told</span> a televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10837">news <span class="marked id-unique-10985">briefing</span>.

The cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-10986">believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-10987">runaway</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10988">train</span>, the railway's</span> operator said.

The president and <span class="marked id-unique-10992">CEO of Rail</span> World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-10996">Montreal, Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-10998">Atlantic Railway</span>, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-11002">train had been parked</span> uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-11003">brakes aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11004">properly <span class="marked id-unique-10909">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11005">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-11006">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10994">away</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-11007">said</span> Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-11010">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-11011">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-11004">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10909">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-11014">mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-10902">disaster</span>, said</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-11002">train was parked</span> because the engineer had finished his <span class="marked id-unique-11017">run.

"We've</span> had a very good <span class="marked id-unique-10930">safety <span class="marked id-unique-10825">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11009">years,"
he said</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11018">decade-old <span class="marked id-unique-10990">railroad</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-11020">Well</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-11021">think</span> we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-11022">blasts <span class="marked id-unique-11023">came</span> over a <span class="marked id-unique-11027">span</span> of several</span> hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-11029">tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-11030">center</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11031">town</span>, destroying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-11032">least <span class="marked id-unique-11033">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10993">buildings</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10847">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11034">tall</span> trees</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-10941">area looked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10901">like
<span class="marked id-unique-11013">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11038">standing</span> matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11040">blackened from bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-11042">tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-10886">Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10872">said</span> the eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11044">sent <span class="marked id-unique-10982">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11045">shook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10991">residents</span> out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-11047">slumber</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11049">sent</span> them <span class="marked id-unique-11051">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-10946">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-11053">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11055">gathered</span> by a <span class="marked id-unique-11056">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11058">bar</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-11059">sent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10957">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-11060">lives</span> after the thunderous</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10843">crash and <span class="marked id-unique-11061">wall</span> of fire</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11063">blazed through the early</span> morning <span class="marked id-unique-11064">sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-10989">Bernard</span> Theberge</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-11065">outside on the bar's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11066">patio at the
time</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11067">crash, feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-11071">inside
the popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-10973">first <span class="marked id-unique-10952">explosion</span> went</span> off.

"<span class="marked id-unique-10908">People started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11072">running and the <span class="marked id-unique-11069">fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10891">ignited</span> almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11073">instantaneously," he said</span>.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-10913">like a <span class="marked id-unique-11075">movie</span>," said</span> Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-10974">considered
himself fortunate</span> to escape with only <span class="marked id-unique-11077">second-degree burns</span>
on his <span class="marked id-unique-11076">right <span class="marked id-unique-10893">arm</span>.

"Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-10850">live."

<span class="marked id-unique-11078">Firefighters</span>, including</span> some from <span class="marked id-unique-11079">Maine, doused</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11080">blaze
for <span class="marked id-unique-11081">hours</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10866">Local</span> fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10923">chief <span class="marked id-unique-11037">Denis</span> Lauzon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10999">described the
<span class="marked id-unique-11085">scene</span> as one</span> akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-11026">zone.

Dozens</span> of residents <span class="marked id-unique-11039">gathered hours</span> after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-11088">edge of a wide</span> security <span class="marked id-unique-11089">perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-11019">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11090">feared</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-11092">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-10984">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles</span>) down the <span class="marked id-unique-11093">town's <span class="marked id-unique-11095">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11096">street</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11099">flames</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10884">danced</span> around</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11101">railway tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-11103">sat at
the <span class="marked id-unique-10956">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11104">road</span>.

"On a beautiful</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11105">evening like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-10846">lot of people</span> there," <span class="marked id-unique-11107">said Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11108">Demers, who
owns</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11109">restaurant near</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11111">blast site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-11113">big
<span class="marked id-unique-11114">explosion</span>. It's a catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
<span class="marked id-unique-11041">population."

<span class="marked id-unique-11115">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-10871">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-10997">home</span>, said</span> the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-11116">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-11117">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

<span class="marked id-unique-10916">Charles <span class="marked id-unique-11118">Coue</span> said</span> he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an <span class="marked id-unique-10952">explosion went</span> off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-10995">came like</span> a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-10999">described the <span class="marked id-unique-11120">scene</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-11121">explosions</span> as "<span class="marked id-unique-11123">dreadful</span>."

"The Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11124">store, Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-10955">gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-11125">said</span>.

Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11126">spokesman Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11001">Blanchette said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-11100">spilled
into the Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) <span class="marked id-unique-11098">River. Blanchette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11110">said the
73</span> cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-10828">crude oil</span>, and at <span class="marked id-unique-11127">least four</span> were
<span class="marked id-unique-10944">damaged by the explosions</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11129">fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-10905">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-10826">lake</span> and the river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-11130">concerning <span class="marked id-unique-11131">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-11133">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10861">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11134">municipalities</span>
downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-11084">careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-11122">take</span> their water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-11135">Chaudiere <span class="marked id-unique-11136">River</span>."

He <span class="marked id-unique-11138">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-11139">mobile</span> laboratory</span> had been set up to
monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-10875">quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-11140">air</span>.

Firefighters</span> and rescue <span class="marked id-unique-11083">workers from several</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10842">neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-11141">municipalities</span>, including</span> Sherbrooke and
<span class="marked id-unique-11142">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-11025">deal with
the disaster</span>.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-11143">northern Maine</span> were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-11145">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11146">town</span>, according</span> to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-11147">sheriff's
office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-11150">Franklin County</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-11148">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10918">Stephen Harper</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11151">expressed his sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-10851">thoughts and <span class="marked id-unique-10932">prayers</span> go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-11152">families and

The train</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11164">reportedly <span class="marked id-unique-11149">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11137">toward</span> Maine</span>, belongs to
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-11166">Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-11008">Atlantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-11086">According</span> to the railroad's</span>

toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11173">still-swollen <span class="marked id-unique-11070">Bow</span> River</span>. The derailed <span class="marked id-unique-10945">rail cars</span>
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-11174">without spilling</span> their cargo.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10954">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11175">accident</span> was likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-11057">impact across</span> the

had previously <span class="marked id-unique-11012">raised <span class="marked id-unique-11082">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-11177">threat</span> of an

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-10829">AP) - <span class="marked id-unique-10838">Fires</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10841">continued</span> burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-10833">nearly <span class="marked id-unique-10845">24</span> hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-10987">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-11170">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10832">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10828">crude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10848">oil</span> derailed</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-10849">eastern <span class="marked id-unique-10853">Quebec</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10854">igniting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10860">explosions</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-10862">fires</span> that destroyed</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-10863">town's <span class="marked id-unique-10865">center</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10869">killed</span> at
<span class="marked id-unique-10844">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10831">one</span> person</span>. Police <span class="marked id-unique-10876">said they expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions <span class="marked id-unique-10840">sent residents</span> of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-10881">intense <span class="marked id-unique-10882">heat</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-10859">towering</span>
fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-10836">red glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-10883">illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-10868">night</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10885">sky</span>,
witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10856">said. Flames</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10887">billowing <span class="marked id-unique-10888">black</span> smoke</span> could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-10879">long after the 73-car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10839">train derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-10864">000 <span class="marked id-unique-10878">people</span> were forced</span> from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-10834">155 <span class="marked id-unique-10892">miles</span>
(250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-10894">miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-10895">16</span> kilometers</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-10896">west of the <span class="marked id-unique-10874">Maine</span> border</span>.

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-10855">provincial police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10898">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10899">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-10831">one person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-10877">died. He <span class="marked id-unique-10900">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-10903">say</span> how <span class="marked id-unique-10904">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10906">others</span>
might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-10858">dead, but <span class="marked id-unique-10907">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10910">authorities</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-10835">told</span> "<span class="marked id-unique-10911">many</span>"
<span class="marked id-unique-10950">people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-10912">reported</span> missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-10914">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10915">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-10919">spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-10897">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10855">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10870">police</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10921">said</span>: "I don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10924">want to <span class="marked id-unique-10867">get</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-10925">numbers</span>, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-10926">say</span> is we do <span class="marked id-unique-10927">expect</span> we'll</span> have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-10931">deceased <span class="marked id-unique-10933">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-10873">Lapointe</span> refused</span> to give any estimate of people <span class="marked id-unique-10935">unaccounted
for because <span class="marked id-unique-10936">police</span> were having <span class="marked id-unique-10938">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10939">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-10940">fixed</span> number</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-10917">People are calling</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-10943">reported love</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-10949">missing, some
people</span> are reported <span class="marked id-unique-10953">two, three</span> times missing by different
members of the <span class="marked id-unique-10958">family," he <span class="marked id-unique-10852">said</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10959">derailment</span> caused</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10961">several tanker</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10945">rail <span class="marked id-unique-10963">cars</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-10965">explode</span>
in the <span class="marked id-unique-10966">downtown</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-10857">popular</span> area</span> packed with <span class="marked id-unique-10968">bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-10969">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10830">bustles</span> on summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10971">weekend nights</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-10870">Police <span class="marked id-unique-10972">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10973">first</span> explosion</span> tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-10975">town
shortly</span> after 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-10977">local time</span>. The fire then spread to
<span class="marked id-unique-10978">several homes</span>.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-11030">center of your town</span> almost <span class="marked id-unique-10981">destroyed,
you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-10934">asking ourselves how we
are going</span> to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette <span class="marked id-unique-10983">Roy-Laroche <span class="marked id-unique-10827">told</span> a televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10837">news <span class="marked id-unique-10985">briefing</span>.

The cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-10986">believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-10987">runaway</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10988">train</span>, the railway's</span> operator said.

The president and <span class="marked id-unique-10992">CEO of Rail</span> World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-11166">Maine & Atlantic</span> Railway, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-11002">train had been parked</span> uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-11003">brakes aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11004">properly applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11005">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-11006">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10994">away</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-11007">said</span> Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-11010">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-11011">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-11004">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10909">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-11014">mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-10902">disaster</span>, said</span> the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his <span class="marked id-unique-11017">run.

"We've</span> had a very good <span class="marked id-unique-10930">safety <span class="marked id-unique-10825">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11009">years,"
he said</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11018">decade-old <span class="marked id-unique-10990">railroad</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-11020">Well</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-11021">think</span> we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-11022">blasts <span class="marked id-unique-11023">came</span> over a <span class="marked id-unique-11027">span</span> of several</span> hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-11029">tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-11030">center</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11031">town</span>, destroying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-11032">least <span class="marked id-unique-11033">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10993">buildings</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10847">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11034">tall</span> trees</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-10941">area looked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10901">like
<span class="marked id-unique-11013">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11038">standing</span> matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11040">blackened from bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-11042">tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-10886">Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10872">said</span> the eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11044">sent <span class="marked id-unique-10982">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11045">shook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10991">residents</span> out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-11047">slumber</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11049">sent</span> them <span class="marked id-unique-11051">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-10946">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-11053">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11055">gathered</span> by a <span class="marked id-unique-11056">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11058">bar</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-11059">sent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10957">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-11060">lives</span> after the thunderous</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10843">crash and <span class="marked id-unique-11061">wall</span> of fire</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11063">blazed through the early</span> morning <span class="marked id-unique-11064">sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-10989">Bernard</span> Theberge</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-11065">outside on the bar's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11066">patio at the
time</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11067">crash, feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-11071">inside
the popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-10973">first <span class="marked id-unique-10952">explosion</span> went</span> off.

"<span class="marked id-unique-10908">People started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11072">running and the <span class="marked id-unique-11069">fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10891">ignited</span> almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11073">instantaneously," he said</span>.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-10913">like a <span class="marked id-unique-11075">movie</span>," said</span> Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-10974">considered
himself fortunate</span> to escape with only <span class="marked id-unique-11077">second-degree burns</span>
on his <span class="marked id-unique-11076">right <span class="marked id-unique-10893">arm</span>.

"Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-10850">live."

<span class="marked id-unique-11078">Firefighters</span>, including</span> some from <span class="marked id-unique-11079">Maine, doused</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11080">blaze
for <span class="marked id-unique-11081">hours</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10866">Local</span> fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10923">chief <span class="marked id-unique-11037">Denis</span> Lauzon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10999">described the
<span class="marked id-unique-11085">scene</span> as one</span> akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-11026">zone.

Dozens</span> of residents <span class="marked id-unique-11039">gathered hours</span> after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-11088">edge of a wide</span> security <span class="marked id-unique-11089">perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-11019">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11090">feared</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-11092">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-10984">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles</span>) down the <span class="marked id-unique-11093">town's <span class="marked id-unique-11095">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11096">street</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11099">flames</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10884">danced</span> around</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11101">railway tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-11103">sat at
the <span class="marked id-unique-10956">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11104">road</span>.

"On a beautiful</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11105">evening like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-10846">lot of people</span> there," <span class="marked id-unique-11107">said Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11108">Demers, who
owns</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11109">restaurant near</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11111">blast site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-11113">big
<span class="marked id-unique-11114">explosion</span>. It's a catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
<span class="marked id-unique-11041">population."

<span class="marked id-unique-11115">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-10871">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-10997">home</span>, said</span> the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-11116">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-11117">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

<span class="marked id-unique-10916">Charles <span class="marked id-unique-11118">Coue</span> said</span> he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-10995">came like</span> a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the <span class="marked id-unique-11120">scene of the
<span class="marked id-unique-11121">explosions</span> as "<span class="marked id-unique-11123">dreadful</span>."

"The Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11124">store, Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-10955">gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-11125">said</span>.

Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11126">spokesman Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11001">Blanchette said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-11100">spilled
into the Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) <span class="marked id-unique-11098">River. Blanchette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11110">said the
73</span> cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-10828">crude oil</span>, and at <span class="marked id-unique-11127">least four</span> were
<span class="marked id-unique-10944">damaged by the explosions</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11129">fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-10905">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-10826">lake</span> and the river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-11130">concerning <span class="marked id-unique-11131">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-11133">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10861">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11134">municipalities</span>
downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-11084">careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-11122">take</span> their water</span> from

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-11186">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-11187">one person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-11188">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-11187">one <span class="marked id-unique-11189">person</span> had died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-11190">reported missing</span>.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-11192">center of town</span>, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-11186">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-11194">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11195">town</span>, according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-11196">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-11197">statement.

"Our thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11191">prayers go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-11198">families and
friends</span> of those affected by this <span class="marked id-unique-11199">morning's tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11200">train
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can <span class="marked id-unique-11201">return to their <span class="marked id-unique-11202">homes</span> safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-11193">tank <span class="marked id-unique-11203">cars</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11186">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling <span class="marked id-unique-11193">tank cars</span> full of <span class="marked id-unique-11186">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small <span class="marked id-unique-11194">Quebec town</span> about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of <span class="marked id-unique-11195">town.

According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the <span class="marked id-unique-11192">center of town</span> in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail <span class="marked id-unique-11203">cars carrying</span>
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-11186">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-11188">73-car train</span> actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the <span class="marked id-unique-11203">cars
carrying</span> the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been <span class="marked id-unique-11190">reported missing</span>."

were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-11205">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-11220">Montreal, Maine</span> and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-11222">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-11241">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-11205">crude <span class="marked id-unique-11207">oil</span> derailed</span> at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-11219">runaway train</span> with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-11222">Lac-Megantic
in Quebec</span> before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-11212">Witnesses said</span> the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-11225">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-11224">several hours</span>
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-11209">000 people</span>.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-11218">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-11215">almost
<span class="marked id-unique-11216">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11217">you'll</span> understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-11214">asking ourselves
how we are going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-11213">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-11220">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-11228">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-11227">Quebec and New</span>
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-11206">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident <span class="marked id-unique-11226">Claude Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11221">described the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, <span class="marked id-unique-11232">everything that was
there is gone</span>."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-11230">like an atomic</span> bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-11210">hot. Everybody</span> was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-11237">Chaudiere
River</span>.

Environment Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11233">spokesman Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-11238">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-11229">monitor the quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-11204">lake and the river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-11234">concerning <span class="marked id-unique-11235">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-11236">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11208">local</span> municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-11231">take their water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-11237">Chaudiere River</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-11239">Firefighters and rescue</span> workers had to be called in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-11240">municipalities, including</span> Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-11211">help <span class="marked id-unique-11223">deal</span> with the disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-11228">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-11243">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-11244">one person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-11251">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-11253">intense <span class="marked id-unique-11254">heat</span> of towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-11250">night sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-11255">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-11256">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-11245">train</span> derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-11257">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-11248">provincial</span> police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11258">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-11259">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-11244">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

<span class="marked id-unique-11261">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-11262">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-11257">Quebec provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11251">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-11264">people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-11266">found</span> deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-11251">Police said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11269">first explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-11271">Rail World</span> Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-11272">Montreal, Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-11273">Atlantic Railway</span>, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-11274">train had been parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11275">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-11276">properly <span class="marked id-unique-11260">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11277">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-11278">run</span> away</span>," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-11280">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-11281">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-11276">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11260">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-11274">train was parked</span> because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-11282">finished his run</span>.

"We've had a very good <span class="marked id-unique-11267">safety <span class="marked id-unique-11242">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11279">years,"
he said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "<span class="marked id-unique-11283">Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-11284">think</span> we've</span>
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-11287">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-11249">early morning</span> sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-11270">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-11269">first explosion</span> went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-11294">right arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-11295">evening like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-11246">lot of people</span> there," said Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-11296">Demers, who
owns</span> a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-11298">big
<span class="marked id-unique-11299">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-11300">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-11301">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-11302">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-11252">hot. ... Everybody</span> was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-11243">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-11304">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11263">Stephen Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-11247">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-11305">train
<span class="marked id-unique-11286">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-11306">homes <span class="marked id-unique-11307">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-11268">quickly</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-11308">people</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11297">surrounding areas</span>
can <span class="marked id-unique-11285">rest <span class="marked id-unique-11309">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-11310">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-11265">monitoring</span> the
situation</span> and we stand by <span class="marked id-unique-11292">ready to <span class="marked id-unique-11303">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-11289">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11293">requested</span> by the province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-11311">Maine & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-11290">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11291">Maine, Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11288">Quebec and
New</span> Brunswick.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-11312">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-11243">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-11272">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-11311">Maine</span> and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-11312">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-11270">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-11243">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-11294">right arm</span>.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-11244">one person</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-11286">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-11261">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-11262">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11257">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-11248">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-11264">people <span class="marked id-unique-11266">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-11287">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-11253">intense <span class="marked id-unique-11254">heat</span>
as the towering</span> flames lit up the <span class="marked id-unique-11250">night sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-11269">first explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-11271">Rail World</span>, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-11272">Montreal,
<span class="marked id-unique-11311">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-11273">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, said the <span class="marked id-unique-11256">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-11274">train</span> was parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11275">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span> after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-11282">finished
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-11276">properly <span class="marked id-unique-11260">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11277">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-11278">run</span> away</span>," said Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-11280">think the <span class="marked id-unique-11281">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-11276">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11260">applied</span> on this train</span>." "We've had a very
good <span class="marked id-unique-11267">safety <span class="marked id-unique-11242">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11279">years," he said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-11283">Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-11284">think</span> we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-11305">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-11290">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11288">Quebec, New</span> Brunswick, <span class="marked id-unique-11291">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-11248">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-11251">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-11245">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-11255">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-11248">provincial police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11258">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-11259">Michel</span> Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-11296">Demers, who owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-11249">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-11298">big explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11301">like an <span class="marked id-unique-11302">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-11252">hot. ... Everybody</span> was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-11295">evening like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-11246">lot of people</span> there. It was a big <span class="marked id-unique-11299">explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-11300">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-11304">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11263">Stephen Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-11247">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-11306">homes <span class="marked id-unique-11307">safely</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11268">quickly</span>. The
<span class="marked id-unique-11308">people</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11297">surrounding areas</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-11285">rest
<span class="marked id-unique-11309">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-11310">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-11265">monitoring</span> the situation</span> and
we stand by <span class="marked id-unique-11292">ready to <span class="marked id-unique-11303">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-11289">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11293">requested</span> by
the province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

to <span class="marked id-unique-11347">increase</span>.

The eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11334">sent residents</span> of Lac-Megantic scrambling

a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-11401">likened the charred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11402">scene to a war <span class="marked id-unique-11358">zone</span>.

Up to 2,000</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11383">people were forced</span> from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-11365">000 <span class="marked id-unique-11404">people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-11325">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11405">miles</span>

The <span class="marked id-unique-11487">derailment</span> caused</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11489">several <span class="marked id-unique-11331">tanker</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11470">rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11491">cars</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-11493">explode</span>
in the <span class="marked id-unique-11494">downtown</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-11354">popular</span> area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11361">packed with <span class="marked id-unique-11496">bars</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-11497">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11320">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-11498">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11501">weekend</span> nights</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-11372">Police <span class="marked id-unique-11502">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11503">first</span> explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11505">tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-11506">town</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-11512">several homes</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-11514">see the center</span> of your town <span class="marked id-unique-11516">almost <span class="marked id-unique-11517">destroyed</span>,

The cause</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11525">accident was <span class="marked id-unique-11527">believed</span> to be a <span class="marked id-unique-11528">runaway</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11529">train</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-11530">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11534">operator</span> said</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-11536">president and <span class="marked id-unique-11538">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11541">Rail</span> World</span> Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-11543">Montreal, Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-11546">Atlantic Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11548">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-11552">train</span> had been parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11554">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-11555">brakes aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11556">properly <span class="marked id-unique-11426">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11557">going

Burkhardt</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-11569">mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-11418">disaster</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11548">said</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-11552">train</span> was parked</span> because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-11570">finished his <span class="marked id-unique-11573">run</span>.

"We've</span> had a very good <span class="marked id-unique-11453">safety <span class="marked id-unique-11313">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11561">years,"

The <span class="marked id-unique-11581">blasts <span class="marked id-unique-11583">came</span> over a <span class="marked id-unique-11587">span</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11588">several</span> hours</span> as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-11590">tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-11591">center</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11593">town</span>, destroying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-11594">least <span class="marked id-unique-11595">30</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-11395">Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11375">said</span> the eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11609">sent <span class="marked id-unique-11521">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11610">shook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11537">residents</span> out

<span class="marked id-unique-11618">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11620">gathered</span> by a <span class="marked id-unique-11621">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11623">bar</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-11624">sent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11485">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-11626">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-11380">thunderous</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11337">crash</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11627">wall</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11628">fire</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11630">blazed</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-11360">early</span> morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11631">sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-11533">Bernard</span> Theberge</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-11632">outside on the bar's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11633">patio at the

the <span class="marked id-unique-11553">popular</span> Musi-Cafe</span> when the <span class="marked id-unique-11503">first <span class="marked id-unique-11479">explosion</span> went</span> off.

"<span class="marked id-unique-11425">People started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11642">running and the <span class="marked id-unique-11638">fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11403">ignited</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11579">almost</span>

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-11431">like a <span class="marked id-unique-11645">movie</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-11647">said</span> Theberge</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-11504">considered
himself fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-11648">escape with only <span class="marked id-unique-11649">second-degree</span> burns</span>
on his <span class="marked id-unique-11646">right <span class="marked id-unique-11406">arm</span>.

"Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-11346">live."

<span class="marked id-unique-11650">Firefighters</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11393">including</span> some from <span class="marked id-unique-11651">Maine</span>, doused</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11652">blaze

Dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11424">residents <span class="marked id-unique-11603">gathered</span> hours</span> after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-11663">edge of a wide</span> security <span class="marked id-unique-11664">perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-11576">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11665">feared</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-11667">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-11523">kilometer</span> (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-11668">miles</span>) down the <span class="marked id-unique-11669">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11672">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11673">street</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11676">flames</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11391">danced</span> around</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11678">railway <span class="marked id-unique-11532">tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-11680">sat</span> at

"On a beautiful</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11682">evening like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-11684">bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-11340">lot</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11318">people</span> there," <span class="marked id-unique-11685">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11564">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11686">Demers</span>, who
owns</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11687">restaurant near</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11689">blast site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-11692">big
<span class="marked id-unique-11693">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-11694">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible</span> for the

<span class="marked id-unique-11695">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-11374">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-11545">home</span>, said</span> the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-11697">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-11698">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11699">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-11373">hot</span>. ... Everybody</span> was afraid."

<span class="marked id-unique-11435">Charles <span class="marked id-unique-11700">Coue</span> said</span> he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-11500">felt the <span class="marked id-unique-11701">heat</span> as they
<span class="marked id-unique-11702">sprinted</span> from their <span class="marked id-unique-11703">home</span> after an <span class="marked id-unique-11479">explosion</span> went</span> off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It <span class="marked id-unique-11704">went <span class="marked id-unique-11551">boom</span> and it <span class="marked id-unique-11542">came</span> like</span> a fireball," he said.

Another resident <span class="marked id-unique-11596">Claude Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11547">described the <span class="marked id-unique-11706">scene</span> of the

The eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11334">sent residents</span> of Lac-Megantic scrambling

"If <span class="marked id-unique-11555">brakes aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11556">properly <span class="marked id-unique-11426">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11557">going

<span class="marked id-unique-11630">blazed</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-11360">early</span> morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11631">sky.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-11431">like a <span class="marked id-unique-11645">movie</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-11647">said</span> Theberge</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-11504">considered

on his <span class="marked id-unique-11646">right <span class="marked id-unique-11406">arm</span>.

"Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-11346">live."

<span class="marked id-unique-11650">Firefighters</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-11393">including</span> some from <span class="marked id-unique-11651">Maine</span>, doused</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11652">blaze

the <span class="marked id-unique-11663">edge of a wide</span> security <span class="marked id-unique-11664">perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-11576">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11665">feared</span> the

"On a beautiful</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11682">evening like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-11684">bar, there

<span class="marked id-unique-11695">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-11374">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-11545">home</span>, said</span> the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-11697">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-11698">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11699">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-11373">hot</span>. ... Everybody</span> was afraid."

<span class="marked id-unique-11435">Charles <span class="marked id-unique-11700">Coue</span> said</span> he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-11500">felt the <span class="marked id-unique-11701">heat</span> as they
<span class="marked id-unique-11702">sprinted</span> from their <span class="marked id-unique-11703">home</span> after an <span class="marked id-unique-11479">explosion</span> went</span> off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It <span class="marked id-unique-11704">went <span class="marked id-unique-11551">boom</span> and it <span class="marked id-unique-11542">came</span> like</span> a fireball," he said.

Another resident <span class="marked id-unique-11596">Claude Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11547">described the <span class="marked id-unique-11706">scene</span> of the

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-11421">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-11315">lake</span> and the river</span> that is

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-15564">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-15619">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-15621">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-15560">expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-15589">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-15581">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-15574">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-15596">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-15612">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-15610">confirmed</span> that
one person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-15552">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-15603">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15583">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three <span class="marked id-unique-15537">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-15544">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15541">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15585">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-15606">see</span> the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-15621">destroyed</span>,

are <span class="marked id-unique-15614">going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-15561">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-15563">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15580">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15588">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15578">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-15538">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-15569">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-15550">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-15614">going</span>
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-15586">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-15602">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-15611">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-15613">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-15616">early</span> morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-15579">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-15615">feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-15582">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-15601">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-15576">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-15617">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-15543">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-15539">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-15556">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-15615">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-15590">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-15613">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-15566">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-15562">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-15565">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-15542">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-15577">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-15572">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-15618">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-15584">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-15587">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-15592">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-15604">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-15598">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-15555">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15557">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-15554">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15551">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-15607">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15608">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-15620">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-15593">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-15591">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15594">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15558">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-15559">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-15609">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-15571">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-15553">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15548">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-15575">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-15620">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-15540">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-15573">500</span> miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-15605">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15549">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-15595">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15597">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-15545">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-15547">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-15567">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-15612">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-15600">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-15568">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-15615">feared</span> in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-15566">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-15545">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-15603">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-15589">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-15611">buildings</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-15621">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-15574">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-15596">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-15613">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-15540">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-15616">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-15600">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-15576">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-15617">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-15560">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-15610">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-15552">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-15583">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-15537">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15544">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15585">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15541">members</span>.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-15564">continued</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-15619">24</span> hours.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-15612">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than <span class="marked id-unique-15619">24</span> hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-15579">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15601">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the time, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-15543">escape</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15615">feared</span> for
those <span class="marked id-unique-15582">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15613">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-15617">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-15539">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-15556">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-15568">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-15590">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-15547">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-15572">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-15618">filled</span> with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-15584">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15550">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-15586">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-15602">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before <span class="marked id-unique-15614">going</span> to a local hotel for the night.

The cars <span class="marked id-unique-15618">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-15542">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-15620">Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-15606">see</span> the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-15621">destroyed</span>,

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-15567">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15577">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-15562">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman
<span class="marked id-unique-15565">Christian</span> Blanchette, adding that communities <span class="marked id-unique-15587">downstream</span>
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-15592">take</span> care if using
river <span class="marked id-unique-15604">water</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-15555">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15557">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-15554">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15551">quality</span>
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-15598">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-15573">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-15605">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15549">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-15636">AP</span>) - Fires continued <span class="marked id-unique-15653">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15672">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-15667">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-15631">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-15678">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-15632">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-15662">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-15669">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war <span class="marked id-unique-15696">zone</span>.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-15622">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-15644">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-15679">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-15694">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15665">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15698">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-15651">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15624">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-15698">Lapointe</span> refused to <span class="marked id-unique-15647">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15633">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-15625">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-15640">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-15649">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-15626">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-15628">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-15660">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-15627">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-15685">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-15674">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we

<span class="marked id-unique-15668">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15661">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15700">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15635">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15638">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15701">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-15643">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-15639">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-15655">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15693">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15691">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-15692">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-15666">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15689">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-15693">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15691">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-15689">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-15688">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-15677">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-15648">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15692">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-15680">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-15699">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15690">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-15663">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-15658">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-15634">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-15696">zone</span>.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-15697">owns</span> a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-15629">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-15680">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-15637">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-15630">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-15659">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-15646">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-15670">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-15652">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-15688">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-15695">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-15686">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15687">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15684">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-15675">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-15642">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15654">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15641">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-15695">According</span> to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-15623">website</span>, the company <span class="marked id-unique-15697">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-15657">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-15656">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-15683">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15681">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-15671">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15673">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-15645">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-15676">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some <span class="marked id-unique-15699">30</span>,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-15682">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-15631">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-15675">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15627">spread</span> to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-15699">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15690">buildings</span> and sent <span class="marked id-unique-15630">large</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15632">fireballs</span> and mushroom clouds

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (<span class="marked id-unique-15636">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-15678">death</span> toll would <span class="marked id-unique-15645">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-15651">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-15624">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15665">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15698">Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-15679">dead</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-15698">Lapointe</span> would not
<span class="marked id-unique-15647">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-15633">estimate</span> to how many people were <span class="marked id-unique-15625">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-15644">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-15649">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-15646">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-15694">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-15654">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-15641">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-15634">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-15652">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-15642">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-15637">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-15701">Inc</span>., which <span class="marked id-unique-15697">owns</span> the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-15680">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:<span class="marked id-unique-15699">30</span> a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-15700">President</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15635">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15638">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15701">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-15643">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-15666">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15689">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-15639">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-15689">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-15674">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-15655">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15693">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15691">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-15692">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-15693">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15691">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-15677">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-15648">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15692">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-15669">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-15622">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-15672">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-15640">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-15700">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-15680">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-15663">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-15658">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-15682">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-15695">According</span> to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-15623">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15681">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-15671">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15673">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15697">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-15656">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war <span class="marked id-unique-15696">zone</span> Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war <span class="marked id-unique-15696">zone</span>." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-15695">According</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15676">officials</span>, the blasts took
place <span class="marked id-unique-15629">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-15626">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15628">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-15688">disaster</span> forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-15657">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-15660">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-15683">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-15662">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-15670">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-15688">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-15659">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-15664">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15668">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15661">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-15875">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-15941">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15948">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-15907">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15963">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-15991">eastern</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-15763">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-15965">town's</span> center and <span class="marked id-unique-15849">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-15760">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15935">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-15729">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-15888">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-15920">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-15818">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15856">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-15975">red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15768">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-15762">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-15952">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15996">black</span> smoke could
still be <span class="marked id-unique-15973">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15845">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-15757">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15790">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were <span class="marked id-unique-15987">forced</span> from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-15981">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-15964">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-15809">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-15810">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-15813">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15913">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15949">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-15896">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-15906">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15912">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15985">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-15861">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15815">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-15747">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-15940">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15816">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-15896">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15924">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15858">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-15817">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-15777">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15854">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-15773">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-15793">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-15755">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-15883">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15820">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15819">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-15862">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15843">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15988">family</span>," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-15995">caused</span> several <span class="marked id-unique-15966">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-15931">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-15744">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-15745">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15794">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-15823">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15707">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15840">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion <span class="marked id-unique-15886">tore</span> through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-15972">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-15826">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-15878">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-15955">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-15932">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-15937">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15979">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15994">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15974">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-15821">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-15950">briefing</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15869">cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-15801">believed</span> to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-15897">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15839">operator</span> said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15903">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15868">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15880">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15921">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-15905">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-15882">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-15957">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-15990">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-15750">mystified</span> by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-15927">finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-15851">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-15836">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-15879">years</span>,"
he said of the <span class="marked id-unique-15781">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15898">railroad</span>. "Well, I think we've
<span class="marked id-unique-15873">blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a <span class="marked id-unique-15724">span</span> of several hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-15886">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-15779">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-15756">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15717">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15712">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-15844">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-15853">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15721">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15753">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15799">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15796">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15714">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-15935">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-15726">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-15725">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-15782">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-15888">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-15904">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15925">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-15893">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-15846">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-15715">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-15710">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-15798">blazed</span> through the early <span class="marked id-unique-15978">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-15977">outside</span> on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-15976">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-15982">inside</span>
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-15969">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15893">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-15764">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-15759">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-15908">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-15788">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-15771">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15859">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-15728">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15871">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-15956">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-15831">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-15916">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-15983">including</span> some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15776">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-15864">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15980">Lauzon</span> described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-15806">akin</span> to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-15992">Dozens</span> of residents <span class="marked id-unique-15925">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-15938">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-15706">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15830">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15743">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-15704">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-15758">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-15965">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15754">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15719">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-15783">danced</span> around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-15966">tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-15730">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-15938">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15734">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-15933">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-15915">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-15841">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-15829">site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-15997">big</span>
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-15943">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15887">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-15838">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-15926">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-15953">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15951">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-15922">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-15989">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-15958">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-15791">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15787">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-15705">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15929">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-15722">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-15785">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15765">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15703">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-15752">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-15797">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-15876">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15833">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15867">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15998">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-15860">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-15914">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15824">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15939">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-15852">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-15936">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-15942">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-15848">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-15711">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15804">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15855">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-15970">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-15807">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-15961">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-15928">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-15986">four</span> were
<span class="marked id-unique-15784">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-15971">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-15918">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-15866">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-15877">advised</span> the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-15993">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-15945">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-15911">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15919">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-15910">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15899">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-15834">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15812">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-15749">neighboring</span> municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-15983">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15890">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-15732">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-15947">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-15865">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-15748">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-15780">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-15727">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15746">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-15770">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15786">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-15857">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15718">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-15923">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-15930">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-15959">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-15909">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15884">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-15968">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-15984">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15934">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-15894">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15892">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-15822">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-15832">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15874">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-15850">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-15842">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-15828">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-15825">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15837">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15901">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15954">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15895">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-15900">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-15835">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15767">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15885">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15800">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-15738">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15814">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-15962">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-15960">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-15891">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-15708">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-15742">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15739">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-15870">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15805">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-15772">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15872">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15733">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15885">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15720">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15795">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-15735">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15881">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15723">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-15944">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-15917">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-15761">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15774">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15889">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-15740">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15737">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15789">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-15716">threat</span> of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-15971">spill</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15898">railroad</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15967">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-15889">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-15792">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15907">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-15751">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15803">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-15702">year</span>. Each <span class="marked id-unique-15967">tank</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15946">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15766">holds</span> some 30,000 <span class="marked id-unique-15769">gallons</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-15811">113</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-15808">600</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15847">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-15863">Department</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15775">Environmental</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15902">Protection</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-15802">begun</span>

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-15875">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-15941">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15948">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-15907">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15963">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-15991">eastern</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-15763">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-15965">town's</span> center and <span class="marked id-unique-15849">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-15760">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15935">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-15729">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-15888">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-15920">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-15818">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15856">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-15975">red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15768">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-15762">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-15952">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15996">black</span> smoke could
still be <span class="marked id-unique-15973">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15845">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-15757">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15790">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were <span class="marked id-unique-15987">forced</span> from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-15981">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-15964">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-15809">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-15810">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-15813">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15913">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15949">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-15896">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-15906">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15912">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15985">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-15861">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15815">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-15747">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-15940">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15816">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-15896">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15924">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15858">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-15817">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-15777">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15854">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-15773">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-15793">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-15755">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-15883">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15820">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15819">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-15862">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15843">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15988">family</span>," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-15995">caused</span> several <span class="marked id-unique-15966">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-15931">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-15744">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-15745">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15794">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-15823">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15707">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15840">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion <span class="marked id-unique-15886">tore</span> through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-15972">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-15826">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-15878">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-15955">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-15932">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-15937">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15979">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15994">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15974">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-15821">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-15950">briefing</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15869">cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-15801">believed</span> to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-15897">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15839">operator</span> said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15903">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15868">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15880">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15921">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-15905">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-15882">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-15957">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-15990">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-15750">mystified</span> by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-15927">finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-15851">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-15836">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-15879">years</span>,"
he said of the <span class="marked id-unique-15781">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15898">railroad</span>. "Well, I think we've
<span class="marked id-unique-15873">blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a <span class="marked id-unique-15724">span</span> of several hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-15886">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-15779">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-15756">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15717">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15712">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-15844">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-15853">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15721">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15753">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15799">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15796">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15714">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-15935">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-15726">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-15725">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-15782">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-15888">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-15904">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15925">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-15893">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-15846">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-15715">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-15710">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-15798">blazed</span> through the early <span class="marked id-unique-15978">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-15977">outside</span> on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-15976">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-15982">inside</span>
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-15969">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15893">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-15764">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-15759">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-15908">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-15788">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-15771">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15859">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-15728">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15871">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-15956">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-15831">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-15916">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-15983">including</span> some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15776">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-15864">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15980">Lauzon</span> described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-15806">akin</span> to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-15992">Dozens</span> of residents <span class="marked id-unique-15925">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-15938">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-15706">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15830">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15743">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-15704">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-15758">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-15965">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15754">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15719">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-15783">danced</span> around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-15966">tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-15730">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-15938">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15734">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-15933">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-15915">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-15841">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-15829">site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-15997">big</span>
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-15943">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15887">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-15838">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-15926">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-15953">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15951">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-15922">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-15989">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-15958">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-15791">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15787">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-15705">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15929">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-15722">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-15785">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15765">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15703">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-15752">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-15797">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-15876">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15833">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15867">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15998">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-15860">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-15914">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15824">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15939">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-15852">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-15936">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-15942">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-15848">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-15711">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15804">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15855">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-15970">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-15807">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-15961">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-15928">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-15986">four</span> were
<span class="marked id-unique-15784">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-15971">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-15918">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-15866">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-15877">advised</span> the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-15993">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-15945">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-15911">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15919">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-15910">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15899">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-15834">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15812">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-15749">neighboring</span> municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-15983">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15890">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-15732">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-15947">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-15865">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-15748">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-15780">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-15727">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15746">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-15770">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15786">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-15857">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15718">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-15923">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-15930">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-15959">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-15909">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15884">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-15968">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-15984">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15934">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-15894">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15892">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-15822">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-15832">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15874">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-15850">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-15842">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-15828">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-15825">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15837">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15901">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15954">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15895">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-15900">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-15835">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15767">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15885">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15800">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-15738">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15814">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-15962">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-15960">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-15891">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-15708">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-15742">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15739">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-15870">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15805">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-15772">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15872">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15733">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15885">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15720">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15795">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-15735">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15881">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15723">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-15944">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-15917">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-15761">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15774">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15889">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-15740">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15737">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15789">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-15716">threat</span> of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-15971">spill</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15898">railroad</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15967">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-15889">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-15792">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15907">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-15751">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15803">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-15702">year</span>. Each <span class="marked id-unique-15967">tank</span>

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-16030">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-16016">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-16020">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-16030">person</span> had died. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-16033">say</span> how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-16005">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-16033">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-16011">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-16009">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-16024">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-16013">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-16012">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-16022">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-15999">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-16015">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-16021">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-16031">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-16027">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16028">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16026">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-16018">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-16017">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16019">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16006">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-16007">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-16029">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-16010">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-16004">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16001">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-16014">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16008">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-16003">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-16002">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-16023">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-16031">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-16032">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each <span class="marked id-unique-16032">tank</span>
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-16000">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-16025">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-16030">person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling <span class="marked id-unique-16032">tank</span> cars full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-16020">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash <span class="marked id-unique-15999">site</span> as a 'war zone.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-16009">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing <span class="marked id-unique-16005">might</span> have been
out of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-16031">According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-16013">morning</span> was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that <span class="marked id-unique-16011">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-16025">train's</span> conductor stopped in <span class="marked id-unique-16024">nearby</span> Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of <span class="marked id-unique-16000">liters</span> of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-16016">73-car</span> train actually detached half a
mile <span class="marked id-unique-16012">outside</span> of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-16021">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept <span class="marked id-unique-16022">right</span> on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between <span class="marked id-unique-16015">four</span> and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but <span class="marked id-unique-16031">according</span> to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-16105">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-16055">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-16099">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-16121">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-16112">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-16085">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-16047">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-16071">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16069">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-16059">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-16083">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-16073">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-16095">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-16036">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16044">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16086">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-16041">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-16054">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16035">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16064">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-16039">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16063">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16065">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-16077">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-16118">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-16074">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-16082">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-16057">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-16043">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16123">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-16045">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-16093">municipalities</span>
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-16124">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-16088">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-16118">Chaudiere</span> River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-16101">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-16052">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16058">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-16051">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16049">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-16037">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16034">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-16093">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-16048">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-16067">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-16042">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-16116">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-16113">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16114">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16110">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-16089">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-16087">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16090">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-16076">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-16102">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-16050">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-16108">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-16092">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16098">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-16066">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-16056">likely</span> to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-16119">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-16107">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-16121">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16104">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-16074">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-16078">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-16120">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-16082">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-16076">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-16040">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16095">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-16070">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
<span class="marked id-unique-16120">time</span>. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-16055">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-16081">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-16119">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-16075">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-16096">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-16100">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen <span class="marked id-unique-16109">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-16116">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-16121">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-16061">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-16105">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-16122">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-16099">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-16038">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-16091">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-16097">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-16117">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16094">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-16080">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16084">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16079">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-16060">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-16115">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-16101">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-16111">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-16105">almost</span>
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-16046">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16072">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-16115">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-16062">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16053">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16068">Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-16106">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-16113">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16114">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16110">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-16089">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-16087">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-16090">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-16108">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-16092">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16098">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-16103">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-16056">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-16102">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-16036">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16044">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16086">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-16041">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-16047">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-16106">We've</span> never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-16054">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16035">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16064">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-16039">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-16112">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-16071">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16069">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-16059">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-16083">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-16073">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-16107">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16066">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16077">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-16118">Chaudiere</span>
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-16063">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16065">Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-16124">careful</span>
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-16085">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-16052">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16058">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-16051">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16049">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-16057">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-16043">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16123">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-16045">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-16093">municipalities</span>
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-16124">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-16088">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-16118">Chaudiere</span> River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-16037">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16034">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-16067">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-16093">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-16048">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-16042">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-16116">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-16119">border</span> with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-16050">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-16174">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16177">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-16227">person</span>. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-16211">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-16233">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-16126">towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-16217">sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-16180">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-16139">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-16193">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-16189">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-16201">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16167">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16178">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-16227">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-16202">died</span>. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-16166">others</span>
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16190">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-16145">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16125">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-16221">expect</span> we'll have other people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-16220">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16173">deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-16143">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-16155">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16127">three</span> times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-16218">popular</span> area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-16209">first</span> explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16147">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-16162">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16137">operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-16152">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-16165">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-16154">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-16183">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16226">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16224">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-16225">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-16191">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16222">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-16226">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16224">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-16222">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-16170">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-16225">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-16213">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-16142">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-16134">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-16230">years</span>,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-16213">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16150">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-16205">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-16231">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-16140">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-16228">early</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16188">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16217">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-16223">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the <span class="marked id-unique-16218">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-16209">first</span> explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-16187">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-16149">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-16237">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-16204">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-16192">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-16132">security</span> perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-16236">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-16232">lot</span> of people there," said <span class="marked id-unique-16223">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16210">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-16229">owns</span> a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-16206">blast</span> site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-16175">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-16156">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-16136">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-16210">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-16234">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-16219">home</span>, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-16181">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16179">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-16169">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-16184">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-16235">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-16219">home</span> after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-16199">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-16168">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-16172">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16200">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-16195">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-16207">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-16212">air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-16157">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-16216">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-16144">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-16196">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-16194">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16197">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-16186">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-16171">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-16160">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-16159">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-16128">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-16133">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16151">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-16141">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-16138">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-16131">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-16129">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16135">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16164">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-16182">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16161">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-16163">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company <span class="marked id-unique-16229">owns</span> more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-16185">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-16158">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16214">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-16198">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16203">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-16148">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-16153">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-16208">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-16176">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-16146">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-16215">trains</span>
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-16130">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-16227">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-16209">First</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16223">Bernard</span> Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-16235">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-16235">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-16189">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-16231">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-16149">burns</span> to his right <span class="marked id-unique-16237">arm</span>.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-16166">others</span> on the
patio <span class="marked id-unique-16234">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-16211">death</span> of one <span class="marked id-unique-16227">person</span> in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-16186">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-16212">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-16236">evening</span>, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16190">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-16221">expect</span> there
will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-16220">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16173">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-16199">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-16192">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-16201">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16157">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-16233">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-16126">towering</span> flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-16217">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows <span class="marked id-unique-16127">three</span> of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-16209">first</span> explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-16219">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his <span class="marked id-unique-16237">arm</span>. He
said there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-16231">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-16234">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many <span class="marked id-unique-16218">popular</span> bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-16206">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-16233">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-16155">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-16195">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-16176">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-16205">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-16172">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-16168">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-16177">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16147">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-16162">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16137">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-16191">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16222">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-16152">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-16165">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-16193">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-16154">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-16170">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-16225">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-16153">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-16183">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16226">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16224">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-16225">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-16222">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-16226">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16224">applied</span> on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-16213">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-16142">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-16134">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-16230">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-16213">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16150">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-16208">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-16229">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-16185">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-16158">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-16198">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16203">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-16214">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-16132">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-16200">everything</span> by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-16204">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-16187">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-16146">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-16180">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-16174">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-16217">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a <span class="marked id-unique-16232">lot</span> of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-16140">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-16215">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-16202">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16167">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16178">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-16223">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16210">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-16229">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-16219">home</span>.  "<span class="marked id-unique-16228">Early</span> this <span class="marked id-unique-16188">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-16181">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16179">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-16169">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-16184">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-16236">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-16232">lot</span> of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-16175">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-16156">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-16136">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-16210">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-16230">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-16143">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-16130">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-16139">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-16125">want</span> us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-16216">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-16148">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-16144">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-16194">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-16197">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-16196">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-16207">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-16171">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-16160">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-16159">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-16128">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-16133">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16151">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-16141">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-16138">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16131">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-16129">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16135">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16164">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-16182">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16161">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-16163">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-16218">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-16145">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-16411">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-16478">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16485">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-16443">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16500">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-16528">eastern</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-16299">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-16502">town's</span> center and <span class="marked id-unique-16385">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-16468">expected</span> the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-16296">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16472">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-16265">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-16424">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-16456">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-16354">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16392">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-16512">red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16304">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-16298">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-16489">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16533">black</span> smoke could
still be <span class="marked id-unique-16510">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16381">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-16293">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16326">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were <span class="marked id-unique-16524">forced</span> from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-16518">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-16501">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-16345">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-16346">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-16349">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16449">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16486">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-16432">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-16442">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16448">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16522">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-16397">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16351">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-16283">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-16477">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16352">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-16432">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16460">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-16394">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-16353">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-16313">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16390">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-16309">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-16329">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-16291">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-16419">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16356">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16355">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-16398">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16379">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16525">family</span>," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-16532">caused</span> several <span class="marked id-unique-16503">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-16467">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-16280">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-16281">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16330">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-16359">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16243">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16376">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion <span class="marked id-unique-16422">tore</span> through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-16509">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-16362">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-16414">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16492">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-16469">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-16474">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16516">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16531">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16511">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-16357">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-16487">briefing</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16405">cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-16337">believed</span> to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-16433">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16375">operator</span> said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16439">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16404">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-16416">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16457">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-16441">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-16418">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-16494">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-16527">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-16286">mystified</span> by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-16463">finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-16387">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-16372">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-16415">years</span>,"
he said of the <span class="marked id-unique-16317">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16434">railroad</span>. "Well, I think we've
<span class="marked id-unique-16409">blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a <span class="marked id-unique-16260">span</span> of several hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-16422">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-16315">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-16292">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16253">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16248">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-16380">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-16389">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16257">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16289">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16335">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-16332">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16250">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-16472">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-16262">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-16261">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-16318">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-16424">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-16440">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16461">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-16429">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-16382">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-16251">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-16246">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-16334">blazed</span> through the early <span class="marked id-unique-16515">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-16514">outside</span> on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-16513">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-16519">inside</span>
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-16506">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16429">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-16300">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-16295">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-16444">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-16324">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-16307">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16395">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-16264">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16407">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-16493">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-16367">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-16452">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-16520">including</span> some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16312">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-16400">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16517">Lauzon</span> described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-16342">akin</span> to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-16529">Dozens</span> of residents <span class="marked id-unique-16461">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-16475">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-16242">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16366">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16279">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-16240">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-16294">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-16502">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16290">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16255">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-16319">danced</span> around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-16503">tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-16266">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-16475">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16270">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-16470">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-16451">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-16377">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-16365">site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-16534">big</span>
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-16480">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-16423">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-16374">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-16462">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-16490">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16488">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-16458">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-16526">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-16495">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-16327">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16323">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-16241">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16465">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-16258">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-16321">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16301">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16239">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-16288">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-16333">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16412">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16369">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16403">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-16396">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-16450">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16360">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16476">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-16388">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16473">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16479">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-16384">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-16247">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16340">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16391">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-16507">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-16343">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-16498">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-16464">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-16523">four</span> were
<span class="marked id-unique-16320">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-16508">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-16454">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-16402">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-16413">advised</span> the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-16530">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-16482">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-16447">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16455">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-16446">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16435">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-16370">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16348">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-16285">neighboring</span> municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-16520">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16426">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-16268">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-16484">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-16401">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-16284">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-16316">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-16263">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16282">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-16306">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16322">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-16393">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-16254">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-16459">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-16466">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-16496">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-16445">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16420">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-16505">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-16521">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16471">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-16430">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-16428">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-16358">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-16368">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16410">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-16386">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-16378">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-16364">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-16361">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16373">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16437">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-16491">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16431">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-16436">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-16371">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16303">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16421">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16336">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-16274">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16350">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-16499">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-16497">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-16427">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-16244">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-16278">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16275">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-16406">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16341">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-16308">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16408">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16269">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16421">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16256">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16331">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-16271">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16417">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16259">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-16481">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-16453">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-16297">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16310">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16425">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-16276">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16273">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16325">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-16252">threat</span> of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-16508">spill</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-16434">railroad</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16504">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-16425">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-16328">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16443">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-16287">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16339">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-16238">year</span>. Each <span class="marked id-unique-16504">tank</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16483">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16302">holds</span> some 30,000 <span class="marked id-unique-16305">gallons</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-16347">113</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-16344">600</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16383">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-16399">Department</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16311">Environmental</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16438">Protection</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-16338">begun</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16314">developing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16438">protection</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16277">plans</span> for the areas where the trains

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-16411">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-16478">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16485">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-16443">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16500">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-16528">eastern</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-16299">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-16502">town's</span> center and <span class="marked id-unique-16385">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-16468">expected</span> the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-16296">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16472">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-16265">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-16424">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-16456">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-16354">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16392">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-16512">red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16304">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-16298">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-16489">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16533">black</span> smoke could
still be <span class="marked id-unique-16510">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16381">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-16293">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16326">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were <span class="marked id-unique-16524">forced</span> from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-16518">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-16501">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-16345">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-16346">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-16349">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16449">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16486">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-16432">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-16442">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16448">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16522">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-16397">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16351">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-16283">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-16477">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16352">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-16432">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16460">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-16394">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-16353">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-16313">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16390">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-16309">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-16329">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-16291">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-16419">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16356">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16355">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-16398">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16379">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16525">family</span>," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-16532">caused</span> several <span class="marked id-unique-16503">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-16467">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-16280">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-16281">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16330">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-16359">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16243">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16376">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion <span class="marked id-unique-16422">tore</span> through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-16509">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-16362">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-16414">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16492">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-16469">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-16474">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16516">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16531">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16511">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-16357">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-16487">briefing</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16405">cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-16337">believed</span> to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-16433">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16375">operator</span> said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16439">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16404">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-16416">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16457">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-16441">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-16418">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-16494">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-16527">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-16286">mystified</span> by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-16463">finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-16387">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-16372">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-16415">years</span>,"
he said of the <span class="marked id-unique-16317">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16434">railroad</span>. "Well, I think we've
<span class="marked id-unique-16409">blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a <span class="marked id-unique-16260">span</span> of several hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-16422">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-16315">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-16292">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16253">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16248">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-16380">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-16389">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16257">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16289">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16335">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-16332">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16250">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-16472">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-16262">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-16261">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-16318">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-16424">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-16440">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16461">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-16429">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-16382">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-16251">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-16246">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-16334">blazed</span> through the early <span class="marked id-unique-16515">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-16514">outside</span> on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-16513">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-16519">inside</span>
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-16506">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16429">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-16300">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-16295">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-16444">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-16324">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-16307">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16395">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-16264">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16407">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-16493">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-16367">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-16452">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-16520">including</span> some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16312">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-16400">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16517">Lauzon</span> described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-16342">akin</span> to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-16529">Dozens</span> of residents <span class="marked id-unique-16461">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-16475">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-16242">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16366">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16279">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-16240">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-16294">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-16502">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16290">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16255">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-16319">danced</span> around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-16503">tanker</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-16266">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-16475">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16270">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-16470">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-16451">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-16377">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-16365">site</span>. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-16534">big</span>
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-16480">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-16423">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-16374">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-16462">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-16490">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16488">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-16458">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-16526">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-16495">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-16327">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16323">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-16241">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16465">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-16258">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-16321">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16301">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16239">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-16288">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-16333">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16412">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16369">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16403">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-16396">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-16450">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16360">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16476">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-16388">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16473">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16479">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-16384">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-16247">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16340">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16391">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-16507">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-16343">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-16498">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-16464">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-16523">four</span> were
<span class="marked id-unique-16320">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-16508">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-16454">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-16402">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-16413">advised</span> the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-16530">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-16482">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-16447">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16455">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-16446">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16435">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-16370">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16348">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-16285">neighboring</span> municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-16520">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16426">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-16268">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-16484">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-16401">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-16284">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-16316">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-16263">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16282">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-16306">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16322">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-16393">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-16254">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-16459">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-16466">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-16496">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-16445">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16420">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-16505">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-16521">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16471">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-16430">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-16428">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-16358">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-16368">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16410">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-16386">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-16378">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-16364">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-16361">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16373">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-16437">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-16491">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16431">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-16436">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-16371">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16303">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16421">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16336">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-16274">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16350">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-16499">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-16497">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-16427">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-16244">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-16278">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16275">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-16406">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16341">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-16308">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16408">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16269">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16421">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16256">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16331">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-16271">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16417">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16259">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-16481">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-16453">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-16297">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16310">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16425">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-16276">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16273">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16325">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-16252">threat</span> of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-16508">spill</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-16434">railroad</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16504">tank</span> cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-16425">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-16328">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16443">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-16287">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16339">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-16238">year</span>. Each <span class="marked id-unique-16504">tank</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16483">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16302">holds</span> some 30,000 <span class="marked id-unique-16305">gallons</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-16347">113</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-16344">600</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16383">liters</span>) of oil.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-20910">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-20954">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-20921">crude</span> oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-20923">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-20951">one</span> person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-20906">expected</span> the death <span class="marked id-unique-20972">toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-20940">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-20932">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-20920">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-20948">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span>
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-20877">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-20969">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-20951">one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-20898">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-20960">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-20934">Guy</span> Lapointe, a <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span> with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-20973">number</span>.

"People are calling in <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> love ones <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span>, some
people are <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> two, three <span class="marked id-unique-20880">times</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20887">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20884">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-20936">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-20955">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-20965">see</span> the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-20923">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-20892">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20956">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-20916">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-20889">going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-20907">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-20909">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20931">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20939">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20929">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-20881">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-20915">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-20896">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
<span class="marked id-unique-20924">company</span> of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-20925">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-20889">going</span>
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-20937">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-20925">brakes</span> were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-20959">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-20970">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-20878">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous <span class="marked id-unique-20975">crash</span> and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-20978">early</span> morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-20930">patio</span> at the
<span class="marked id-unique-20955">time</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-20975">crash</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20890">feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-20933">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-20958">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-20927">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-20952">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-20886">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-20882">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-20902">live</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-20891">Firefighters</span>, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-20976">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-20951">one</span> akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-20961">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-20890">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span>) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-20941">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-20878">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-20912">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-20974">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-20908">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20911">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20977">Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-20885">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-20928">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-20977">Blanchette</span> said the
<span class="marked id-unique-20918">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-20953">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-20921">crude</span> oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-20935">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-20938">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-20944">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-20963">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-20950">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-20901">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20903">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-20900">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20897">quality</span> of the air.

<span class="marked id-unique-20891">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

<span class="marked id-unique-20891">Firefighters</span> from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span> at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-20966">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20967">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-20922">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-20945">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-20943">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20946">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20904">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-20905">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-20968">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-20917">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-20899">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20894">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-20926">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-20922">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-20883">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the <span class="marked id-unique-20924">company</span> owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-20919">500</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-20964">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20895">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-20947">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20949">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-20888">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span>
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-20893">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-20913">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-20877">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-20957">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-20921">crude</span> oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-20914">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death <span class="marked id-unique-20972">toll</span> set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-20890">feared</span> in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-20912">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-20888">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-20975">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-20960">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-20921">crude</span> oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-20974">fireball</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20940">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-20951">one</span> and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-20961">Dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20970">buildings</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-20923">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-20920">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-20948">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-20878">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for <span class="marked id-unique-20961">dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span> people.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20883">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-20978">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20924">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20957">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-20927">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-20955">time</span> the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-20952">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-20906">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> up to 100 people <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span>.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-20969">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20951">one</span> death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-20898">others</span>," said police <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20934">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-20973">number</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span>
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-20972">toll</span>."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20971">missing</span> several
<span class="marked id-unique-20880">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20887">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20936">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20884">members</span>.

Some 120 <span class="marked id-unique-20891">firefighters</span> have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-20976">blaze</span>, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-20910">continued</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-20954">24</span> hours.

<span class="marked id-unique-20891">Firefighters</span> from across the <span class="marked id-unique-20877">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20962">reported</span> that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-20973">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the <span class="marked id-unique-20955">time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


<span class="marked id-unique-20891">Firefighters</span> fought the <span class="marked id-unique-20976">blaze</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-20954">24</span> hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-20930">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-20958">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the <span class="marked id-unique-20955">time</span>, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-20886">escape</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20890">feared</span> for
those <span class="marked id-unique-20933">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20878">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-20952">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-20882">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-20902">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to <span class="marked id-unique-20951">one</span> of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-20914">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-20941">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-20893">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-20918">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20953">filled</span> with light <span class="marked id-unique-20921">crude</span> oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-20935">four</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span>) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-20924">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span> told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20896">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-20937">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-20959">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-20925">brakes</span> on
"properly" before <span class="marked id-unique-20889">going</span> to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20953">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-20885">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span>, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-20922">Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-20925">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-20879">cars</span> exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-20974">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-20965">see</span> the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-20923">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-20892">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20956">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-20916">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-20889">going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-20907">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-20909">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20931">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20939">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20929">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-20881">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-20915">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20966">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20967">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-20922">Harper</span> said in a <span class="marked id-unique-20945">statement</span>: "Our

and <span class="marked id-unique-20926">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-20913">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20928">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-20908">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20942">spokesman</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20911">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20977">Blanchette</span>, adding that communities <span class="marked id-unique-20938">downstream</span>
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-20944">take</span> care if using
river <span class="marked id-unique-20963">water</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-20901">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20903">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-20900">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20897">quality</span>
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-20950">added</span>.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-20921">crude</span> oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-20919">500</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20876">miles</span>) of <span class="marked id-unique-20964">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20895">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-20999">AP</span>) - <span class="marked id-unique-21058">Fires</span> continued <span class="marked id-unique-21024">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21047">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-21069">carrying</span>
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-21042">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and <span class="marked id-unique-21058">fires</span> that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-20994">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-21056">death</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21073">toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-20995">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-21037">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-21044">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire <span class="marked id-unique-21075">chief</span> likened the charred <span class="marked id-unique-20979">scene</span> to a war <span class="marked id-unique-21005">zone</span>.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-21004">000</span> people were <span class="marked id-unique-21071">forced</span> from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-21004">000</span> people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-20985">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how <span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span> others
<span class="marked id-unique-21015">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-21057">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-21077">authorities</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-21051">told</span> "<span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span>"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-21040">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21007">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-21022">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20987">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-21007">Lapointe</span> refused to <span class="marked id-unique-21018">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-20996">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-20988">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-21074">number</span>.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-21011">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-21072">caused</span> several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-21020">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-20989">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-20991">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-21035">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-20990">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-21064">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-21052">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-21021">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21039">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21043">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21036">Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21051">told</span> a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21049">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20998">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-21009">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21050">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-21014">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21030">company</span> of Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-20981">Atlantic</span> Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-21010">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-21032">brakes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21026">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21002">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20984">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-21001">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21031">away</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-21041">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20983">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-21032">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-21002">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20984">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-20983">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-20982">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-21055">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-21019">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21001">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-21076">blasts</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20980">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-21008">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21067">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span> shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-21038">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-21033">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire <span class="marked id-unique-21075">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20997">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21070">Lauzon</span> described the
<span class="marked id-unique-20979">scene</span> as one akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-21005">zone</span>.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span> feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-21059">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-21006">owns</span> a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-20992">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) <span class="marked id-unique-21031">away</span>.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-20980">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-21000">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the <span class="marked id-unique-20979">scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-20993">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-21034">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-21017">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-21045">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-21023">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-20982">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-21003">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-21065">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21066">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21063">Stephen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21029">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent <span class="marked id-unique-21058">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-21029">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-21053">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-21013">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-21025">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21012">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-20981">Atlantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21003">According</span> to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-20986">website</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-21030">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21006">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-21028">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-21027">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-21062">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-21060">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-21046">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21048">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train <span class="marked id-unique-21069">carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-21016">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-21054">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-21069">carrying</span>
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-20981">Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some <span class="marked id-unique-21008">30</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-21004">000</span> gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-21061">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-20994">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-21069">carrying</span> crude oil -- also set
off a <span class="marked id-unique-21074">number</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21058">fires</span>, which <span class="marked id-unique-21053">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20990">spread</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span> homes

Smoke rises from railway cars that were <span class="marked id-unique-21069">carrying</span> crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-21071">forced</span> the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-21004">000</span> people. (<span class="marked id-unique-20999">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-21056">death</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21073">toll</span> would <span class="marked id-unique-21016">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-21022">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-20987">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-21040">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21007">Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-21057">dead</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-21007">Lapointe</span> would not
<span class="marked id-unique-21018">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-20996">estimate</span> to how <span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span> people were <span class="marked id-unique-20988">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-21015">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-21020">explode</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-21059">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the <span class="marked id-unique-20979">scene</span>, and <span class="marked id-unique-21068">many</span> were fighting multiple <span class="marked id-unique-21058">fires</span> into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-21017">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-21077">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-21025">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-21012">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-21075">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20997">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21070">Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference <span class="marked id-unique-21070">Lauzon</span> said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-21023">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-21013">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-21000">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-20981">Atlantic</span>

the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-20983">Burkhardt</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21051">told</span> The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-21052">understand</span> how the train got <span class="marked id-unique-21031">away</span>.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-21032">brakes</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21026">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21002">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20984">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-21001">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21031">away</span>," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-21032">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-21002">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20984">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-21055">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-21019">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21001">run</span>.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-21030">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21051">told</span> CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-21044">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-20985">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-21047">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-21011">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-21049">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-20981">Atlantic</span>, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-20980">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-21038">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-21033">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-21061">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what <span class="marked id-unique-21072">caused</span> the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-21003">According</span> to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-20986">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-21060">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-21046">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21048">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21006">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-21027">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war <span class="marked id-unique-21005">zone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21070">Lauzon</span> described the <span class="marked id-unique-20979">scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war <span class="marked id-unique-21005">zone</span>." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the <span class="marked id-unique-20979">scene</span> showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-21003">According</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21054">officials</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-21076">blasts</span> took
place <span class="marked id-unique-20992">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-20989">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20991">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-20982">disaster</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21071">forced</span> between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-21028">500</span> and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-21004">000</span> people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-21074">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-21035">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-21062">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-21037">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-21045">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-20982">disaster</span> also <span class="marked id-unique-21071">forced</span> the town
of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-21004">000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-21034">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.

are <span class="marked id-unique-21338">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21257">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a <span class="marked id-unique-21275">televised</span> news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21323">cause</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21096">accident</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21219">believed</span> to be a <span class="marked id-unique-21234">runaway</span>

train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-21360">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-21336">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21264">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-21338">going</span>

brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-21336">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21264">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-21260">Burkhardt</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-21168">mystified</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-21258">disaster</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-21395">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21335">run</span>.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-21344">residents</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21092">gathered</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21108">hours</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-21097">explosion</span> at

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-21329">AP</span>) - <span class="marked id-unique-21109">Fires</span> continued burning late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-21091">nearly</span> 24 <span class="marked id-unique-21108">hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-21234">runaway</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-21355">carrying</span>
crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-21119">derailed</span> in eastern Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-21181">igniting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21343">explosions</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-21109">fires</span> that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-21099">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21081">center</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21303">killed</span> at
<span class="marked id-unique-21107">least</span> one <span class="marked id-unique-21337">person</span>. Police <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> they expected the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-21178">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21093">eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21080">sent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21344">residents</span> of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-21147">scrambling</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-21310">fireballs</span> and a red <span class="marked id-unique-21186">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-21180">illuminated</span> the night <span class="marked id-unique-21251">sky</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-21248">witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21339">Flames</span> and billowing black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-21299">long</span> after the 73-car train <span class="marked id-unique-21119">derailed</span>, and
a <span class="marked id-unique-21111">fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21116">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21175">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21208">charred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21230">scene</span> to a war <span class="marked id-unique-21349">zone</span>.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-21345">000</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21246">people</span> were forced from their <span class="marked id-unique-21247">homes</span> in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-21345">000</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21246">people</span>, which is about 155 <span class="marked id-unique-21231">miles</span>

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21252">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-21254">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21382">Michel</span> Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-21337">person</span> had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-21088">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21112">say</span> how <span class="marked id-unique-21241">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21376">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21381">might</span> be dead, but <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-21241">many</span>"
<span class="marked id-unique-21246">people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-21346">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21354">missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21254">Lt</span>. Guy <span class="marked id-unique-21352">Lapointe</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-21242">spokesman</span> with Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21252">provincial</span>
police, <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span>: "I <span class="marked id-unique-21315">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21269">want</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21257">get</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-21165">numbers</span>, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-21112">say</span> is we do expect <span class="marked id-unique-21333">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-21246">people</span> who will
be found deceased <span class="marked id-unique-21270">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-21352">Lapointe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21088">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21393">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-21312">estimate</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21246">people</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21271">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-21195">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21308">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-21191">fixed</span> number.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21246">People</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-21211">calling</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-21346">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21173">love</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-21354">missing</span>, some

<span class="marked id-unique-21297">members</span> of the family," he <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span>.

The derailment caused <span class="marked id-unique-21098">several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21100">tanker</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21243">rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21265">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-21253">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21239">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21162">packed</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-21104">bars</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-21163">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21212">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-21277">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21125">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21294">nights</span>.

Police <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21235">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21097">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21084">tore</span> through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-21244">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21334">time</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-21111">fire</span> then <span class="marked id-unique-21280">spread</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-21098">several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21247">homes</span>.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-21081">center</span> of your town <span class="marked id-unique-21240">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-21356">you'll</span> understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-21338">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21257">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a <span class="marked id-unique-21275">televised</span> news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21323">cause</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21096">accident</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21219">believed</span> to be a <span class="marked id-unique-21234">runaway</span>
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-21369">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21293">operator</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21373">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21322">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21243">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21358">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21390">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-21375">parent</span>

train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-21360">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-21336">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21264">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-21338">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-21335">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> Edward <span class="marked id-unique-21260">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-21250">think</span> the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-21336">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21264">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-21260">Burkhardt</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-21168">mystified</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-21258">disaster</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-21395">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21335">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21249">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-21305">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21233">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21290">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-21106">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21357">years</span>,"
he <span class="marked id-unique-21232">said</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21199">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21089">railroad</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-21333">Well</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-21250">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21249">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21327">blown</span> it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-21238">came</span> over a <span class="marked id-unique-21142">span</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21098">several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21108">hours</span> as the <span class="marked id-unique-21111">fire</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21084">tore</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-21081">center</span> of town, <span class="marked id-unique-21197">destroying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-21107">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21353">30</span>

of their <span class="marked id-unique-21143">slumber</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21080">sent</span> them <span class="marked id-unique-21200">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-21085">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21374">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21092">gathered</span> by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-21263">bar</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-21080">sent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21087">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-21300">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-21133">thunderous</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21115">crash</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21128">wall</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21111">fire</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21216">blazed</span> through the early morning <span class="marked id-unique-21251">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21262">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21350">Theberge</span>, who was outside on the <span class="marked id-unique-21104">bar's</span> patio at the

"<span class="marked id-unique-21246">People</span> started <span class="marked id-unique-21087">running</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-21111">fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21182">ignited</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21240">almost</span>

on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21343">Explosions</span> as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-21285">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-21385">live</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-21320">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-21331">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21244">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21113">municipalities</span>

the <span class="marked id-unique-21259">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21118">River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-21380">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21388">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-21379">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21370">quality</span> of the air.

<span class="marked id-unique-21348">Firefighters</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-21166">northern</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21095">Maine</span> were also <span class="marked id-unique-21198">deployed</span> to

<span class="marked id-unique-21164">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-21188">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21204">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-21311">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21136">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-21392">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-21398">families</span> and

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's <span class="marked id-unique-21443">center</span> and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-21425">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21401">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
<span class="marked id-unique-21441">witnesses</span> said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-21419">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-21423">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-21442">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-21425">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21401">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-21436">died</span>. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-21435">say</span> how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-21408">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-21403">reported</span> missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-21435">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in <span class="marked id-unique-21403">reported</span> love ones missing, some
people are <span class="marked id-unique-21403">reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21438">derailment</span> caused several tanker rail <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-21440">first</span> explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-21414">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-21443">center</span> of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-21412">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the <span class="marked id-unique-21443">center</span> of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-21441">Witnesses</span> said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-21428">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous <span class="marked id-unique-21437">crash</span> and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-21416">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-21415">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the <span class="marked id-unique-21437">crash</span>, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-21440">first</span> explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-21426">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-21425">one</span> akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-21399">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span> were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-21418">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-21424">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-21402">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-21432">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21433">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21431">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-21421">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-21420">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21422">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21409">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-21410">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-21434">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-21413">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-21407">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21404">tragic</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-21438">derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-21417">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21411">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-21406">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-21405">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-21427">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-21402">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span>
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad <span class="marked id-unique-21429">tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span> carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each <span class="marked id-unique-21429">tank</span>
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-21400">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-21430">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least <span class="marked id-unique-21425">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21401">person</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-21436">died</span>, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling <span class="marked id-unique-21429">tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span> full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-21423">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities <span class="marked id-unique-21442">confirmed</span> the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the <span class="marked id-unique-21437">crash</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21399">site</span> as a 'war zone.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-21412">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

It's hoped that those now feared missing <span class="marked id-unique-21408">might</span> have been

<span class="marked id-unique-21402">According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the <span class="marked id-unique-21443">center</span> of town in Lac

"Joseph R. McGonigle <span class="marked id-unique-21442">confirmed</span> to The Gazette early

brakes and checked to ensure that the rail <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span> carrying
thousands of <span class="marked id-unique-21400">liters</span> of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the <span class="marked id-unique-21440">first</span> conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-21419">73-car</span> train actually detached half a
mile <span class="marked id-unique-21415">outside</span> of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-21424">added</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-21439">cars</span>
carrying the oil kept <span class="marked id-unique-21426">right</span> on rolling."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-21441">witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21403">reported</span> between <span class="marked id-unique-21418">four</span> and six explosions

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-21517">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-21534">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting <span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span>
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-21497">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-21525">one</span> person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-21491">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-21539">still</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-21546">seen</span> long after the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-21503">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-21496">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-21519">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span>
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-21451">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-21474">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21489">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21545">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-21525">one</span> person had <span class="marked id-unique-21520">died</span>. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-21547">say</span> how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-21529">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-21550">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a <span class="marked id-unique-21551">spokesman</span> with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-21448">get</span> into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-21547">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-21481">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-21515">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the <span class="marked id-unique-21533">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several <span class="marked id-unique-21530">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-21482">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-21500">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-21464">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-21541">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-21446">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21497">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-21467">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-21493">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-21448">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-21483">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-21502">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21506">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21501">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
<span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-21510">parked</span> uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span>, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-21449">disaster</span>, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21510">parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-21528">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21447">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-21447">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-21523">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-21456">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-21458">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
<span class="marked id-unique-21464">time</span> of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-21465">feared</span> for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-21446">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21466">Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-21476">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-21532">including</span> some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-21522">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-21525">one</span> akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-21465">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span>) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-21530">tanker</span> that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-21542">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-21507">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-21468">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-21492">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21490">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-21480">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-21505">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21494">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-21518">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-21454">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21462">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21508">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
<span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span> as "<span class="marked id-unique-21459">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-21475">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21453">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21485">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-21457">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-21484">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21551">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21486">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21549">Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-21499">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-21450">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) <span class="marked id-unique-21445">River</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21549">Blanchette</span> said the
<span class="marked id-unique-21495">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-21504">four</span> were
damaged by the <span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span> and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-21531">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-21478">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-21445">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-21461">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-21463">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-21444">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21535">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-21526">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-21512">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-21450">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21445">River</span>."

He <span class="marked id-unique-21524">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-21473">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21479">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-21472">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21470">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-21455">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21452">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-21444">municipalities</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21532">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21469">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-21488">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-21460">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-21449">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a <span class="marked id-unique-21551">spokesman</span> at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-21543">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21544">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21540">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-21513">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-21511">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21514">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span>
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-21498">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-21527">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-21471">province</span>."

The <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span>, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-21538">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-21516">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21521">Brunswick</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21548">Last</span> week a <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow <span class="marked id-unique-21445">River</span>. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-21487">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-21477">likely</span> to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-21451">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-21531">spill</span> from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine <span class="marked id-unique-21548">last</span> year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-21537">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: <span class="marked id-unique-21509">Train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of <span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span>.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-21465">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21529">dead</span>, after the
runaway <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-21495">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-21500">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-21464">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-21504">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-21498">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span> combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-21458">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21518">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-21491">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span> away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
<span class="marked id-unique-21464">time</span>. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-21476">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-21503">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-21451">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-21496">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21519">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-21497">destroyed</span> in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-21523">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be <span class="marked id-unique-21546">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21539">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-21449">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-21465">feared</span> more of the <span class="marked id-unique-21530">tanker</span>
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-21482">explode</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21525">One</span> carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-21446">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-21550">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-21522">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-21456">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-21515">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-21520">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach <span class="marked id-unique-21533">family</span> or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-21545">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21517">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21548">last</span> night.

<span class="marked id-unique-21502">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21506">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21501">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their <span class="marked id-unique-21533">family</span> or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-21481">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-21448">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-21524">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-21541">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-21446">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21497">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21467">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-21493">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-21448">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-21483">event</span>."

Police <span class="marked id-unique-21551">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21474">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21489">Brunet</span> said: "I can <span class="marked id-unique-21547">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-21447">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-21543">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21544">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21540">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-21513">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-21511">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-21514">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-21536">miles</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21538">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-21516">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21521">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> derailed.

He said it was unknown how the <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> ended up out
of control. It had been <span class="marked id-unique-21510">parked</span> some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-21528">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-21510">parked</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-21477">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
<span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never <span class="marked id-unique-21546">seen</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-21509">train</span> travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-21527">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just <span class="marked id-unique-21525">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-21454">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21462">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21508">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-21459">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-21468">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-21447">We've</span> never <span class="marked id-unique-21546">seen</span> anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-21475">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21453">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21485">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-21457">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-21542">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-21525">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21466">explosions</span>
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-21492">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21490">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-21480">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21505">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21494">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-21537">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21487">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21499">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-21450">Chaudiere</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21445">River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21484">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21551">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21486">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21549">Blanchette</span> said
communities <span class="marked id-unique-21535">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-21526">careful</span>
of using <span class="marked id-unique-21445">river</span> water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-21507">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-21473">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21479">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-21472">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21470">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-21531">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-21478">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-21445">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-21461">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-21463">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-21444">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21535">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-21526">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-21512">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-21450">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21445">River</span>."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-21455">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21452">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-21488">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-21444">municipalities</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21532">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21469">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-21460">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-21449">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's <span class="marked id-unique-21534">Eastern</span> Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-21620">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21623">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span> in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-21632">destroyed</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-21676">town's</span> center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-21594">person</span>. Police <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-21671">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-21663">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-21566">towering</span>
fireballs and a <span class="marked id-unique-21677">red</span> glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-21559">sky</span>,
witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21668">Flames</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21626">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21683">black</span> smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-21579">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-21640">73-car</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-21636">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-21653">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21644">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-21645">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21613">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21624">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-21594">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-21654">died</span>. He refused to say how <span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21612">others</span>
might be dead, but <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span>"
people have been reported <span class="marked id-unique-21597">missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21645">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21637">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21674">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21644">provincial</span>
police, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>: "I <span class="marked id-unique-21585">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21565">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-21619">deceased</span> unfortunately."

<span class="marked id-unique-21674">Lapointe</span> refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-21583">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-21597">missing</span>, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-21601">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21567">three</span> times <span class="marked id-unique-21597">missing</span> by different
members of the family," he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-21560">popular</span> area packed with <span class="marked id-unique-21686">bars</span> that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21555">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-21632">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21587">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-21608">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21577">operator</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-21598">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-21611">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the
train had been <span class="marked id-unique-21642">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21600">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-21629">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21593">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21564">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-21592">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21638">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21562">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-21643">think</span> the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-21593">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21564">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-21562">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the
train was <span class="marked id-unique-21642">parked</span> because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-21616">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21592">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21558">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-21582">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21641">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21574">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-21660">years</span>,"
he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-21643">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21558">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21590">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-21657">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-21675">30</span>
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span>
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-21661">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-21580">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-21635">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21559">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21563">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-21679">outside</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-21686">bar's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21678">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the <span class="marked id-unique-21641">safety</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-21680">inside</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-21560">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-21555">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-21634">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> a movie," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-21589">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-21667">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

<span class="marked id-unique-21595">Firefighters</span>, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-21656">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-21639">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-21572">security</span> perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-21676">town's</span> main
street, <span class="marked id-unique-21668">flames</span> danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-21666">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-21662">lot</span> of people there," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21563">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21556">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-21596">owns</span> a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-21658">blast</span> site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-21684">big</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-21621">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-21602">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-21576">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-21556">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-21664">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21561">home</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> was "<span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-21627">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21625">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-21615">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-21682">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21630">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-21665">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-21561">home</span> after an <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-21651">fireball</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>.

Another resident Claude <span class="marked id-unique-21685">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-21614">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-21618">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21652">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-21647">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-21659">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-21672">air</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21595">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-21603">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

<span class="marked id-unique-21595">Firefighters</span> from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-21584">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-21648">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-21646">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21649">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-21633">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-21681">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21617">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21669">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21606">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-21605">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-21568">surrounding</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21687">areas</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21669">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21573">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21591">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-21581">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-21578">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-21571">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-21569">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-21575">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21610">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-21628">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21607">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-21609">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company <span class="marked id-unique-21596">owns</span> more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-21631">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-21604">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-21650">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21655">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products <span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span>
in <span class="marked id-unique-21588">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The <span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span> rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-21599">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-21670">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-21622">car</span> holds some <span class="marked id-unique-21675">30</span>,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-21586">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the <span class="marked id-unique-21687">areas</span> where the trains
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-21570">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> recently.

One dead, <span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21597">missing</span> as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-21594">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span> at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-21555">First</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21563">Bernard</span> Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-21665">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-21665">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-21636">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-21661">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-21678">patio</span>.
"It was <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> an apocalyptic vision," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-21589">burns</span> to his right <span class="marked id-unique-21667">arm</span>.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-21612">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-21678">patio</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21664">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-21671">death</span> of one <span class="marked id-unique-21594">person</span> in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-21633">subsequent</span> explosions that shot <span class="marked id-unique-21668">flames</span> hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-21672">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-21666">evening</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21645">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21637">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21674">Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-21644">provincial</span> police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-21619">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-21651">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21632">destroyed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21675">30</span> buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-21639">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as <span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-21653">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21603">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for <span class="marked id-unique-21641">safety</span>, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-21663">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-21566">towering</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21668">flames</span> lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-21559">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> he knows <span class="marked id-unique-21567">three</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-21597">missing</span> people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-21680">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span>.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-21555">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the <span class="marked id-unique-21668">flames</span> a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-21561">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span>, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:<span class="marked id-unique-21675">30</span> a.m., scorched his <span class="marked id-unique-21667">arm</span>. He
<span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-21661">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-21664">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>
the town centre, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21560">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21686">bars</span>, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-21658">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-21663">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was <span class="marked id-unique-21679">outside</span> his house <span class="marked id-unique-21601">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
<span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> he had to <span class="marked id-unique-21647">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-21622">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-21657">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-21618">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-21614">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-21595">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-21623">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21587">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-21608">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21577">operator</span>,
the <span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span> train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-21638">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21562">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-21598">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-21611">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21640">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-21642">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21600">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-21616">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-21592">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-21599">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-21629">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21593">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21564">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-21592">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21562">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-21643">think</span> the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-21593">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21564">applied</span> on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-21558">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-21582">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21641">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21574">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-21660">years</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>. "Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-21643">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21558">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21590">blown</span> it here."

<span class="marked id-unique-21553">Like</span> a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-21670">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-21596">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-21631">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-21604">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-21650">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21655">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train <span class="marked id-unique-21679">outside</span>
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>
there are <span class="marked id-unique-21572">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-21652">everything</span> by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-21642">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
<span class="marked id-unique-21557">many</span> fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation <span class="marked id-unique-21641">Safety</span> Board of Canada is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-21683">black</span> box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-21644">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  <span class="marked id-unique-21645">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21674">Lapointe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-21656">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-21634">started</span> before the train
<span class="marked id-unique-21673">derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-21586">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-21674">Lapointe</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-21626">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-21620">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-21559">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We <span class="marked id-unique-21669">can</span> still see a <span class="marked id-unique-21662">lot</span> of
<span class="marked id-unique-21683">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-21595">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> Leonard <span class="marked id-unique-21685">Bedard</span>, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-21580">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through <span class="marked id-unique-21676">towns</span>. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

<span class="marked id-unique-21685">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> that is "mostly businesses <span class="marked id-unique-21632">destroyed</span>, but about
<span class="marked id-unique-21675">30</span> to 40 houses as well. I <span class="marked id-unique-21681">hope</span> they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-21654">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
<span class="marked id-unique-21597">missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-21644">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-21645">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-21613">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21624">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-21563">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21556">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-21596">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-21561">home</span>.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-21635">morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-21684">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-21627">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21625">bomb</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-21615">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-21682">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21630">afraid</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-21666">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-21662">lot</span> of people there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-21684">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21552">explosion</span>. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-21621">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-21602">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-21576">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-21556">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-21660">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "<span class="marked id-unique-21682">Everybody</span> is very
friendly ... It's <span class="marked id-unique-21553">like</span> a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-21677">Red</span> Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-21583">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21677">Red</span> Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-21570">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-21579">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-21565">want</span> us to." Beauchesne <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-21595">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-21588">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-21584">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-21646">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-21649">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-21648">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-21659">added</span>: “We <span class="marked id-unique-21681">hope</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21617">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21669">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21606">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-21605">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-21568">surrounding</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21687">areas</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21669">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21573">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-21591">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-21581">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-21578">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21571">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-21569">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-21575">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21610">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-21628">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21607">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-21609">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-21560">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-21585">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-21680">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she <span class="marked id-unique-21554">said</span>. “When you <span class="marked id-unique-21643">think</span> of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-21701">nearly</span> 24 <span class="marked id-unique-21718">hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-21845">runaway</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-21968">carrying</span>

to <span class="marked id-unique-21789">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21703">eruptions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21690">sent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21957">residents</span> of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-21758">scrambling</span>

still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-21912">long</span> after the 73-car train <span class="marked id-unique-21729">derailed</span>, and

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-21958">000</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21857">people</span> were forced from their <span class="marked id-unique-21858">homes</span> in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-21958">000</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21857">people</span>, which is about 155 <span class="marked id-unique-21842">miles</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-21802">fixed</span> number.

The derailment caused <span class="marked id-unique-21708">several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21710">tanker</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21854">rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21877">cars</span> to explode

<span class="marked id-unique-21859">Police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21843">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21846">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21707">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21694">tore</span> through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-21855">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21947">time</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-21721">fire</span> then <span class="marked id-unique-21893">spread</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-21708">several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21858">homes</span>.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-21691">center</span> of your town <span class="marked id-unique-21851">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-21969">you'll</span> understand that we're asking ourselves how we

Colette Roy-Laroche told a <span class="marked id-unique-21888">televised</span> news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21936">cause</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21706">accident</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21830">believed</span> to be a <span class="marked id-unique-21845">runaway</span>
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-21982">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21906">operator</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21843">said</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21986">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-21935">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-21854">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21971">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22003">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-21988">parent</span>

train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-21973">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-21949">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21876">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-21951">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-21948">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-21843">said</span> Edward <span class="marked id-unique-21872">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-21862">think</span> the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-21949">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21876">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-21872">Burkhardt</span>, who was <span class="marked id-unique-21779">mystified</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-21870">disaster</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-21843">said</span> the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-22008">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-21948">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-21861">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-21918">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21844">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21903">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-21716">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21970">years</span>,"
he <span class="marked id-unique-21843">said</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21810">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21699">railroad</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-21946">Well</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-21862">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21861">we've</span>

Colette Roy-Laroche told a <span class="marked id-unique-21888">televised</span> news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-21936">cause</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-21706">accident</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-21830">believed</span> to be a <span class="marked id-unique-21845">runaway</span>

"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-21949">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21876">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-21951">going</span>

"<span class="marked id-unique-21946">Well</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-21862">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21861">we've</span>

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-25295">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-25291">expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-25320">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-25312">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-25305">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25327">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-25345">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-25343">confirmed</span> that
one person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-25283">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-25334">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25314">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three <span class="marked id-unique-25268">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-25275">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25272">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25316">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-25337">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-25277">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25330">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-25301">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-25292">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-25294">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25311">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25319">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25309">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-25269">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-25300">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-25281">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-25317">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-25333">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-25344">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-25346">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-25310">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-25313">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-25332">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-25307">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-25339">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-25274">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-25270">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-25287">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-25321">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-25346">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-25297">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25293">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25296">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-25273">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-25308">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-25303">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-25342">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-25315">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-25318">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-25323">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-25335">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-25329">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-25286">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25288">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-25285">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25282">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-25338">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25340">Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-25324">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-25322">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25325">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25289">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-25290">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25341">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-25302">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-25284">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25279">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-25306">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-25271">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25304">500</span> miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-25336">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25280">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-25326">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25328">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-25276">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-25278">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-25298">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-25345">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-25331">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-25299">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-25297">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-25276">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-25334">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-25320">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-25344">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-25305">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-25327">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-25346">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-25271">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-25331">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-25307">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-25339">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-25291">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-25343">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-25283">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25314">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-25268">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25275">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25316">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25272">members</span>.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-25295">continued</span> for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-25345">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-25310">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25332">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the time, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-25274">escape</span> and feared for
those <span class="marked id-unique-25313">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25346">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-25339">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-25270">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-25287">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-25299">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-25321">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-25278">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-25303">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-25342">filled</span> with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-25315">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25281">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-25317">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-25333">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars <span class="marked id-unique-25342">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-25273">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

<span class="marked id-unique-25319">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25309">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-25269">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-25300">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-25338">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25340">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-25324">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-25322">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25325">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25289">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-25290">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25341">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-25302">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-25284">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25279">tragic</span> train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-25306">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-25298">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25308">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-25293">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman
<span class="marked id-unique-25296">Christian</span> Blanchette, adding that communities <span class="marked id-unique-25318">downstream</span>
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-25323">take</span> care if using
river <span class="marked id-unique-25335">water</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-25286">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25288">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-25285">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25282">quality</span>
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-25329">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-25304">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-25336">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25280">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-25326">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25328">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-25312">lakeside</span> town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US <span class="marked id-unique-25345">border</span> with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-25361">AP</span>) - Fires continued <span class="marked id-unique-25378">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25397">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-25392">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-25356">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-25403">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-25357">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-25387">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-25394">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25347">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-25369">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-25404">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25390">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-25376">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25349">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-25372">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25358">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-25350">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-25365">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-25374">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-25351">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-25353">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-25385">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-25352">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-25410">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-25399">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-25375">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25389">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25393">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25386">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25412">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25360">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25363">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25414">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-25368">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-25364">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25380">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25420">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25418">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-25419">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-25391">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25416">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-25420">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25418">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-25416">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-25415">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-25402">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-25373">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25419">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-25405">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-25417">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-25388">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-25383">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25359">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-25354">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-25405">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25362">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-25355">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-25384">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-25371">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-25395">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-25377">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-25415">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-25411">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25413">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25409">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-25400">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-25367">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25379">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25366">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-25348">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25382">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-25381">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-25408">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25406">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-25396">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25398">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-25370">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-25401">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-25407">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

<span class="marked id-unique-25411">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25413">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25409">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,

caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-25356">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-25400">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25352">spread</span> to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
<span class="marked id-unique-25417">buildings</span> and sent <span class="marked id-unique-25355">large</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25357">fireballs</span> and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (<span class="marked id-unique-25361">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-25403">death</span> toll would <span class="marked id-unique-25370">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-25376">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-25349">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25390">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-25404">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-25372">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-25358">estimate</span> to how many people were <span class="marked id-unique-25350">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-25369">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-25374">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-25371">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-25379">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-25366">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25359">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-25377">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-25367">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-25362">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-25414">Inc</span>., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-25405">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-25412">President</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25360">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25363">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25414">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-25368">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-25391">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25416">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-25364">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-25416">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-25399">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-25380">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25420">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25418">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-25419">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-25420">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25418">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-25402">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-25373">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25419">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-25394">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-25347">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-25397">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-25365">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-25412">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-25405">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-25388">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-25383">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-25407">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-25348">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25406">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-25396">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25398">Brunswick</span> and owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25381">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-25401">officials</span>, the blasts took
place <span class="marked id-unique-25354">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-25351">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25353">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-25415">disaster</span> forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-25382">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-25385">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-25408">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-25387">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-25395">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-25415">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-25384">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25389">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25393">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25386">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-25594">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-25660">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25667">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-25626">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25682">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying

and fires that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-25684">town's</span> center and <span class="marked id-unique-25568">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-25479">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25654">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25448">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-25607">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-25639">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-25537">towering</span>

a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25476">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25509">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-25683">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-25528">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-25615">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25643">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25577">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-25536">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-25496">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25573">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-25492">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-25512">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-25474">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-25602">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25539">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25538">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-25581">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25562">members</span> of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-25650">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-25463">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-25464">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25513">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-25542">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25426">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25559">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion <span class="marked id-unique-25605">tore</span> through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-25545">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-25597">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-25674">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-25651">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-25656">emotional</span> Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a <span class="marked id-unique-25540">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-25669">briefing</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25588">cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-25520">believed</span> to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-25616">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25558">operator</span> said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25622">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25587">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25599">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25640">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-25624">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-25601">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25676">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-25469">mystified</span> by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-25646">finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-25570">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-25555">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-25598">years</span>,"
he said of the <span class="marked id-unique-25500">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25617">railroad</span>. "Well, I think we've
<span class="marked id-unique-25592">blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a <span class="marked id-unique-25443">span</span> of several hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-25605">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-25498">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-25475">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25436">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25431">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-25563">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-25572">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25440">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25472">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25518">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-25515">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25433">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-25654">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-25445">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-25444">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-25501">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-25607">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-25623">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25644">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-25612">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-25565">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-25434">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-25429">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-25517">blazed</span> through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started <span class="marked id-unique-25612">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-25483">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-25478">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-25627">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-25507">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-25490">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25578">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-25447">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25590">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-25675">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-25550">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-25635">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25495">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25583">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-25525">akin</span> to a war zone.

Dozens of residents <span class="marked id-unique-25644">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-25657">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-25425">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25549">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25462">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-25423">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-25477">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-25684">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25473">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25438">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-25502">danced</span> around a railway tanker that <span class="marked id-unique-25449">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-25657">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25453">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-25652">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-25634">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-25560">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-25548">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-25662">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25606">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-25557">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-25645">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-25672">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25670">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-25641">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-25677">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25510">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25506">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-25424">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25648">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-25441">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-25504">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25484">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25422">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-25471">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-25516">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25595">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25552">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25586">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-25579">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-25633">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25543">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25658">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-25571">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25655">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25661">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-25567">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-25430">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25523">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25574">fuel</span> had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-25526">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-25680">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-25647">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least four were
<span class="marked id-unique-25503">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-25637">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-25585">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-25596">advised</span> the local municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-25664">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-25630">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25638">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-25629">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25618">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-25553">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25531">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-25468">neighboring</span> municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-25609">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25451">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-25666">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-25584">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-25467">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-25499">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-25446">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25465">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-25489">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25505">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-25576">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25437">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-25642">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-25649">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-25678">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-25628">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25603">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-25653">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25613">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25611">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-25541">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-25551">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25593">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-25569">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-25561">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-25547">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-25544">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25556">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25620">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25673">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25614">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-25619">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-25554">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25486">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25604">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25519">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-25457">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25533">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25681">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-25679">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-25610">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-25427">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-25461">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25458">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-25589">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25524">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-25491">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25591">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25452">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25604">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25439">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25514">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-25454">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25600">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25442">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-25663">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-25636">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-25480">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25493">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25608">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-25459">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25456">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25508">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-25435">threat</span> of an
accident and a spill from <span class="marked id-unique-25617">railroad</span> tank cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-25608">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-25511">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25626">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-25470">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25522">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-25421">year</span>. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-25665">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25485">holds</span> some 30,000 <span class="marked id-unique-25488">gallons</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-25530">113</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-25527">600</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25566">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-25582">Department</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25494">Environmental</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25621">Protection</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-25521">begun</span>

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-25594">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-25660">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25667">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-25626">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25682">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-25482">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a <span class="marked id-unique-25684">town's</span> center and <span class="marked id-unique-25568">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-25479">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25654">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25448">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-25607">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-25639">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-25537">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25575">fireballs</span> and a red <span class="marked id-unique-25487">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-25481">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-25671">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-25564">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25476">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25509">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-25683">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-25528">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-25529">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25532">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25632">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25668">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-25615">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-25625">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25631">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-25580">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25534">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-25466">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-25659">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25535">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-25615">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25643">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25577">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-25536">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-25496">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25573">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-25492">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-25512">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-25474">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-25602">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25539">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25538">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-25581">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25562">members</span> of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-25650">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-25463">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-25464">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25513">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-25542">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25426">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25559">nights</span>.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25676">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going

<span class="marked id-unique-25605">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-25498">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-25475">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25436">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25431">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-25563">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-25572">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25440">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25472">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25518">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-25515">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25433">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-25654">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-25445">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-25444">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-25501">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-25607">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-25623">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25644">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-25612">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-25565">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-25434">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-25429">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-25517">blazed</span> through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started <span class="marked id-unique-25612">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-25483">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-25478">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-25627">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-25507">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-25490">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25578">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-25447">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25590">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-25675">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-25550">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-25635">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25495">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25583">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-25525">akin</span> to a war zone.

Dozens of residents <span class="marked id-unique-25644">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-25657">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-25425">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25549">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25462">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-25423">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-25477">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-25684">town's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25473">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25438">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-25502">danced</span> around a railway tanker that <span class="marked id-unique-25449">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-25657">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25453">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-25652">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-25634">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-25560">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-25548">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-25662">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25606">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-25557">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-25645">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-25672">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25670">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-25641">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-25677">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25510">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25506">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-25424">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25648">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-25441">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-25504">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25484">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25422">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-25471">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-25516">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25595">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25552">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25586">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-25579">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-25633">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25543">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25658">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-25571">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25655">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25661">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-25567">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-25430">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25523">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25574">fuel</span> had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-25526">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-25680">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-25647">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least four were
<span class="marked id-unique-25503">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-25637">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-25585">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-25596">advised</span> the local municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-25664">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-25630">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25638">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-25629">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25618">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-25553">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25531">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-25468">neighboring</span> municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-25609">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25451">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-25666">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-25584">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-25467">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-25499">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-25446">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25465">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-25489">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25505">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-25576">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25437">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-25642">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-25649">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-25678">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-25628">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25603">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-25653">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25613">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25611">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-25541">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-25551">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25593">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-25569">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-25561">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-25547">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-25544">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25556">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25620">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25673">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25614">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-25619">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-25554">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25486">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25604">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25519">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-25457">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25533">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25681">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-25679">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-25610">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-25427">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-25461">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25458">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-25589">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25524">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-25491">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25591">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25452">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25604">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25439">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25514">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-25454">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25600">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25442">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-25663">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-25636">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-25480">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25493">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25608">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-25459">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25456">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25508">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-25435">threat</span> of an
accident and a spill from <span class="marked id-unique-25617">railroad</span> tank cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-25608">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-25511">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25626">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-25470">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25522">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-25421">year</span>. Each tank

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-25716">person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-25702">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25706">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-25716">person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-25691">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-25697">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-25695">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a <span class="marked id-unique-25710">nearby</span> bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-25699">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-25698">outside</span> on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-25708">right</span> arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast <span class="marked id-unique-25685">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-25701">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-25707">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-25717">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-25713">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25714">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25712">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-25704">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-25703">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25705">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25692">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-25693">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25715">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-25696">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-25690">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25687">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-25700">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25694">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25689">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25688">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25709">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-25717">According</span> to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 <span class="marked id-unique-25686">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-25711">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-25716">person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-25706">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash <span class="marked id-unique-25685">site</span> as a 'war zone.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-25695">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing <span class="marked id-unique-25691">might</span> have been
out of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-25717">According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-25699">morning</span> was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that <span class="marked id-unique-25697">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-25711">train's</span> conductor stopped in <span class="marked id-unique-25710">nearby</span> Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of <span class="marked id-unique-25686">liters</span> of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-25702">73-car</span> train actually detached half a
mile <span class="marked id-unique-25698">outside</span> of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-25707">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept <span class="marked id-unique-25708">right</span> on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between <span class="marked id-unique-25701">four</span> and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but <span class="marked id-unique-25717">according</span> to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one <span class="marked id-unique-25716">person</span> has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-25713">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25714">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25712">Stephen</span> Harper

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-25778">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-25754">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-25793">still</span> be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-25765">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-25759">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25780">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25737">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25752">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25801">confirmed</span> that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-25781">died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-25788">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-25799">get</span> into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-25744">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-25775">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-25745">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-25762">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-25795">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-25789">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-25730">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-25756">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-25799">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-25746">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-25764">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25768">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25763">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-25800">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-25787">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-25790">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-25790">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-25784">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-25722">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-25724">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-25789">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-25739">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-25783">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-25796">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-25769">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25731">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-25755">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25753">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-25743">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-25767">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-25757">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-25779">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-25720">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25728">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25770">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-25725">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-25738">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25719">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25748">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-25723">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-25747">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25749">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-25761">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-25802">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-25758">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-25766">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-25741">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-25727">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-25729">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-25777">municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-25772">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-25802">Chaudiere</span> River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-25785">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-25736">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25742">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-25735">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25733">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-25721">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25718">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-25777">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-25732">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-25751">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-25726">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-25800">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-25797">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25798">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25794">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-25773">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-25771">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25774">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-25760">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-25786">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-25734">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-25792">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-25776">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25782">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-25750">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-25740">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-25791">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-25788">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-25758">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-25762">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-25766">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-25760">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-25724">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25779">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-25754">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-25739">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-25765">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-25759">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-25780">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-25784">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen <span class="marked id-unique-25793">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-25800">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-25745">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-25789">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-25783">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-25722">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-25775">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-25781">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-25801">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25778">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-25764">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25768">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25763">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-25744">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-25799">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-25785">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-25795">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-25789">almost</span>
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-25730">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-25756">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-25799">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-25746">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25737">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25752">Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-25790">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-25797">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25798">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25794">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-25773">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-25771">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-25774">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-25792">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-25776">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25782">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-25787">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-25740">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-25786">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25720">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25728">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25770">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-25725">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-25731">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-25790">We've</span> never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-25738">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25719">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25748">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-25723">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25796">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-25755">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25753">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-25743">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-25767">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-25757">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-25791">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25750">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25761">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-25802">Chaudiere</span>
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-25747">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-25749">Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-25769">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-25736">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25742">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-25735">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25733">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-25741">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-25727">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-25729">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-25777">municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-25772">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-25802">Chaudiere</span> River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-25721">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25718">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-25751">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-25777">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-25732">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-25726">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-25800">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-25734">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-25852">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25855">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-25889">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-25900">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-25804">towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-25896">sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-25858">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-25817">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-25871">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-25867">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25879">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25845">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25856">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-25880">died</span>. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-25844">others</span>
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25868">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-25823">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25803">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-25905">expect</span> we'll have other people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-25902">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25851">deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-25821">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-25833">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25805">three</span> times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-25897">popular</span> area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-25887">first</span> explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25825">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-25840">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25815">operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25830">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-25843">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-25832">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25861">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-25869">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25907">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-25907">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-25848">finished</span> his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-25892">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-25820">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-25812">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-25891">years</span>,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-25892">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25828">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-25883">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-25898">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-25818">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-25866">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25896">sky</span>.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the <span class="marked id-unique-25897">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-25887">first</span> explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-25865">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-25827">burns</span>
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-25882">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-25870">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-25810">security</span> perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-25906">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-25899">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-25888">Demers</span>, who
owns a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-25884">blast</span> site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-25853">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25834">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-25814">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25888">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-25903">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25901">home</span>, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-25859">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25857">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-25847">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-25862">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-25904">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-25901">home</span> after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-25877">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-25846">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-25850">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25878">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-25873">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-25885">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-25890">air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-25835">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-25895">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-25822">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-25874">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-25872">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25875">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-25864">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-25849">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25838">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25837">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-25806">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-25811">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25829">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-25819">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-25816">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-25809">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-25807">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25813">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25842">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25860">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25839">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-25841">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-25863">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-25836">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25893">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-25876">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25881">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-25826">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-25831">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-25886">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-25854">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-25824">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-25894">trains</span>
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-25808">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-25887">First</span>, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-25904">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-25904">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-25867">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-25898">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-25827">burns</span> to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-25844">others</span> on the
patio <span class="marked id-unique-25903">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-25889">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-25864">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-25890">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-25906">evening</span>, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25868">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-25905">expect</span> there
will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-25902">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25851">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-25877">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-25870">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-25879">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25835">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-25900">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-25804">towering</span> flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-25896">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows <span class="marked id-unique-25805">three</span> of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-25887">first</span> explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-25901">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-25898">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-25903">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many <span class="marked id-unique-25897">popular</span> bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-25884">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-25900">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-25833">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-25873">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-25854">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-25883">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-25850">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-25846">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-25855">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25825">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-25840">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25815">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-25869">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25907">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25830">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-25843">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-25871">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-25832">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-25848">finished</span>
his run. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-25831">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25861">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-25907">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-25892">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-25820">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-25812">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-25891">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-25892">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25828">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-25886">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25863">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-25836">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-25876">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25881">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-25893">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-25810">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-25878">everything</span> by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-25882">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-25865">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-25824">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-25858">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-25852">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-25896">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a <span class="marked id-unique-25899">lot</span> of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-25818">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-25894">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-25880">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25845">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25856">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-25888">Demers</span>, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-25901">home</span>.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-25866">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-25859">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25857">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-25847">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-25862">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-25906">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-25899">lot</span> of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-25853">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25834">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-25814">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-25888">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-25891">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-25821">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-25808">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-25817">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-25803">want</span> us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-25895">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-25826">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-25822">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-25872">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-25875">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-25874">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-25885">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-25849">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25838">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25837">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-25806">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-25811">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25829">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-25819">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-25816">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25809">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-25807">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25813">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25842">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25860">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25839">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-25841">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-25897">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-25823">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-26081">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-26148">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26155">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-26113">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26170">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-25969">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-26055">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-26138">expected</span> the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-25966">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-26142">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25935">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-26094">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-26126">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-26024">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26062">fireballs</span> and a red <span class="marked id-unique-25974">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-25968">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-26159">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-26051">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25963">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25996">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-26171">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-26015">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-26016">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-26019">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-26119">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26156">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-26102">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-26112">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26118">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-26067">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26021">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-25953">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-26147">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26022">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-26102">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-26130">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-26064">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-26023">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-25983">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26060">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-25979">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-25999">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-25961">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-26089">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26026">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26025">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-26068">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26049">members</span> of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-26137">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-25950">packed</span> with bars that
<span class="marked id-unique-25951">often</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26000">bustles</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-26029">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25913">weekend</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26046">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion <span class="marked id-unique-26092">tore</span> through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-26032">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-26084">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-26162">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-26139">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-26144">emotional</span> Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a <span class="marked id-unique-26027">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-26157">briefing</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-26075">cause</span> of the accident was <span class="marked id-unique-26007">believed</span> to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-26103">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26045">operator</span> said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-26109">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-26074">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-26086">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26127">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-26111">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-26088">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-26164">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was <span class="marked id-unique-25956">mystified</span> by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-26133">finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-26057">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-26042">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-26085">years</span>,"
he said of the <span class="marked id-unique-25987">decade-old</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26104">railroad</span>. "Well, I think we've
<span class="marked id-unique-26079">blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a <span class="marked id-unique-25930">span</span> of several hours as the fire
<span class="marked id-unique-26092">tore</span> through the center of town, <span class="marked id-unique-25985">destroying</span> at least 30
buildings. <span class="marked id-unique-25962">Lines</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25923">tall</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25918">trees</span> in the area <span class="marked id-unique-26050">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-26059">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25927">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25959">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26005">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-26002">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25920">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-26142">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-25932">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-25931">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-25988">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-26094">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-26110">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26131">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-26099">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-26052">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-25921">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-25916">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-26004">blazed</span> through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started <span class="marked id-unique-26099">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-25970">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-25965">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-26114">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-25994">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-25977">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-26065">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-25934">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26077">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-26163">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-26037">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-26122">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25982">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-26070">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-26012">akin</span> to a war zone.

Dozens of residents <span class="marked id-unique-26131">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-26145">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-25912">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26036">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25949">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-25910">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-25964">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the town's <span class="marked id-unique-25960">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25925">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-25989">danced</span> around a railway tanker that <span class="marked id-unique-25936">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-26145">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25940">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-26140">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-26121">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-26047">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-26035">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-26150">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-26093">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-26044">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-26132">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-26160">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26158">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-26128">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-26165">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25997">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25993">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-25911">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26135">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-25928">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-25991">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25971">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25909">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-25958">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-26003">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-26082">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26039">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26073">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-26066">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-26120">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26030">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26146">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-26058">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-26143">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-26149">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-26054">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-25917">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26010">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-26061">fuel</span> had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-26013">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-26168">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-26134">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least four were
<span class="marked id-unique-25990">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-26124">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-26072">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-26083">advised</span> the local municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-26152">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-26117">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26125">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-26116">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-26105">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-26040">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26018">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-25955">neighboring</span> municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-26096">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25938">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-26154">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-26071">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-25954">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-25986">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-25933">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25952">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-25976">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25992">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-26063">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25924">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-26129">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-26136">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-26166">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-26115">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26090">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-26141">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-26100">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-26098">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-26028">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-26038">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26080">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-26056">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-26048">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-26034">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-26031">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-26043">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-26107">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-26161">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26101">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-26106">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-26041">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25973">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26091">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-26006">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-25944">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26020">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-26169">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-26167">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-26097">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-25914">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-25948">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25945">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-26076">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26011">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-25978">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26078">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25939">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26091">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25926">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26001">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-25941">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26087">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25929">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-26151">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-26123">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-25967">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25980">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-26095">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-25946">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25943">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25995">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-25922">threat</span> of an
accident and a spill from <span class="marked id-unique-26104">railroad</span> tank cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-26095">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-25998">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26113">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-25957">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26009">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-25908">year</span>. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-26153">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25972">holds</span> some 30,000 <span class="marked id-unique-25975">gallons</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-26017">113</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-26014">600</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26053">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-26069">Department</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25981">Environmental</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26108">Protection</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-26008">begun</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25984">developing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26108">protection</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25947">plans</span> for the areas where the trains

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-26081">AP</span>) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-26148">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26155">burning</span> late
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-26113">nearly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26170">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-25969">igniting</span> explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-26055">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-26138">expected</span> the death toll
to <span class="marked id-unique-25966">increase</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-26142">eruptions</span> sent residents of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25935">scrambling</span>
through the <span class="marked id-unique-26094">streets</span> under the <span class="marked id-unique-26126">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-26024">towering</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26062">fireballs</span> and a red <span class="marked id-unique-25974">glow</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-25968">illuminated</span> the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-26159">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-26051">long</span> after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-25963">likened</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25996">charred</span> scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-26171">155</span> miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-26015">250</span> kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(<span class="marked id-unique-26016">16</span> kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-26019">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-26119">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26156">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He <span class="marked id-unique-26102">refused</span> to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-26112">others</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26118">might</span> be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-26067">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26021">want</span> to get into <span class="marked id-unique-25953">numbers</span>, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-26147">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26022">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe <span class="marked id-unique-26102">refused</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-26130">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-26064">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-26023">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having <span class="marked id-unique-25983">difficulty</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26060">getting</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-25979">fixed</span> number.

"People are <span class="marked id-unique-25999">calling</span> in reported <span class="marked id-unique-25961">love</span> ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-26089">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26026">three</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26025">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-26068">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26049">members</span> of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-26137">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area <span class="marked id-unique-25950">packed</span> with bars that

<span class="marked id-unique-26059">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25927">standing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25959">matchsticks</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26005">blackened</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-26002">bottom</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25920">tip</span>.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-26142">eruptions</span> sent many <span class="marked id-unique-25932">shook</span> residents out
of their <span class="marked id-unique-25931">slumber</span> and sent them <span class="marked id-unique-25988">darting</span> through the <span class="marked id-unique-26094">streets</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-26110">Patrons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26131">gathered</span> by a nearby bar were sent <span class="marked id-unique-26099">running</span> for
their <span class="marked id-unique-26052">lives</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-25921">thunderous</span> crash and <span class="marked id-unique-25916">wall</span> of fire
<span class="marked id-unique-26004">blazed</span> through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started <span class="marked id-unique-26099">running</span> and the fire <span class="marked id-unique-25970">ignited</span> almost
<span class="marked id-unique-25965">instantaneously</span>," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-26114">movie</span>," said Theberge, who <span class="marked id-unique-25994">considered</span>
himself <span class="marked id-unique-25977">fortunate</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-26065">escape</span> with only <span class="marked id-unique-25934">second-degree</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26077">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-26163">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-26037">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-26122">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25982">doused</span> the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-26070">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one <span class="marked id-unique-26012">akin</span> to a war zone.

Dozens of residents <span class="marked id-unique-26131">gathered</span> hours after the explosion at
the <span class="marked id-unique-26145">edge</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-25912">wide</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26036">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25949">perimeter</span> and many feared the
<span class="marked id-unique-25910">worst</span>. About a <span class="marked id-unique-25964">kilometer</span> (0.6 miles) down the town's <span class="marked id-unique-25960">main</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25925">street</span>, flames <span class="marked id-unique-25989">danced</span> around a railway tanker that <span class="marked id-unique-25936">sat</span> at
the <span class="marked id-unique-26145">edge</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25940">road</span>.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-26140">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-26121">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-26047">near</span> the blast <span class="marked id-unique-26035">site</span>. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-26150">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-26093">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-26044">population</span>."

Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-26132">fled</span> his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-26160">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26158">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-26128">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-26165">afraid</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25997">Charles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25993">Coue</span> said he and his <span class="marked id-unique-25911">wife</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26135">felt</span> the heat as they
<span class="marked id-unique-25928">sprinted</span> from their home after an explosion went off a
<span class="marked id-unique-25991">couple</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25971">hundred</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25909">yards</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-25958">meters</span>) away.

"It went <span class="marked id-unique-26003">boom</span> and it came like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-26082">Another</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26039">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26073">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-26066">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-26120">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26030">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26146">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-26058">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-26143">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-26149">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-26054">large</span> but <span class="marked id-unique-25917">undetermined</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26010">amount</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-26061">fuel</span> had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (<span class="marked id-unique-26013">Ah-DER-Re</span>) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-26168">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-26134">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least four were
<span class="marked id-unique-25990">damaged</span> by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-26124">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-26072">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-26083">advised</span> the local municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-26152">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-26117">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26125">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-26116">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-26105">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-26040">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26018">workers</span> from several
<span class="marked id-unique-25955">neighboring</span> municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-26096">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-25938">Saint-Georges-de-Beauce</span>, were <span class="marked id-unique-26154">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-26071">deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from <span class="marked id-unique-25954">northern</span> Maine were also <span class="marked id-unique-25986">deployed</span> to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the <span class="marked id-unique-25933">sheriff's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25952">office</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-25976">Franklin</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25992">County</span>.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-26063">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25924">sympathy</span> in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-26129">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-26136">families</span> and
friends of those <span class="marked id-unique-26166">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-26115">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26090">tragic</span> train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-26141">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-26100">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-26098">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-26028">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-26038">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26080">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-26056">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-26048">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-26034">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-26031">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-26043">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-26107">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-26161">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26101">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-26106">province</span>."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-26041">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25973">heading</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26091">toward</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-26006">belongs</span> to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-25944">railroad's</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26020">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-26169">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-26167">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-26097">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last <span class="marked id-unique-25914">week</span> a train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-25948">petroleum</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25945">products</span> derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-26076">Calgary</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-26011">Alberta</span>, when a <span class="marked id-unique-25978">flood-damaged</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26078">bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25939">sagged</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-26091">toward</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25926">still-swollen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26001">Bow</span> River. The derailed rail cars
were <span class="marked id-unique-25941">removed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26087">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25929">spilling</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-26151">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-26123">likely</span> to have an <span class="marked id-unique-25967">impact</span> across the
border. In Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25980">environmentalists</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-26095">state</span> officials
had <span class="marked id-unique-25946">previously</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25943">raised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25995">concerns</span> about the <span class="marked id-unique-25922">threat</span> of an
accident and a spill from <span class="marked id-unique-26104">railroad</span> tank cars carrying
crude oil across the <span class="marked id-unique-26095">state</span>.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway <span class="marked id-unique-25998">carried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26113">nearly</span> 3
<span class="marked id-unique-25957">million</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26009">barrels</span> of oil across Maine last <span class="marked id-unique-25908">year</span>. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-26153">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25972">holds</span> some 30,000 <span class="marked id-unique-25975">gallons</span> (<span class="marked id-unique-26017">113</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-26014">600</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26053">liters</span>) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-26069">Department</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25981">Environmental</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26108">Protection</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-26008">begun</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25984">developing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-26108">protection</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25947">plans</span> for the areas where the trains
