One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-4271">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of <span class="marked id-unique-4269">town.

LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-4272">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-4273">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-4275">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the <span class="marked id-unique-4277">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4278">Guy Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-4279">expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-4280">people</span> found</span> deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4281">000 people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-4283">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-4276">Montreal,
<span class="marked id-unique-4287">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-4285">brakes
were properly</span> applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-4270">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-4286">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4288">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-4289">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4290">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-4282">hotel for the night</span>.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-4274">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-4293">parked
the train</span> and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-4294">McGonigle told</span> Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial <span class="marked id-unique-4291">police said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-4296">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some <span class="marked id-unique-4292">people are
missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-4284">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4297">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4298">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-4295">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-4284">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
<span class="marked id-unique-4299">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-4270">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-4291">Police have said</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-4279">expect more <span class="marked id-unique-4280">people</span> to be found</span> dead
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-4271">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-4273">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-4269">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-4296">black smoke</span> into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-4281">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-4283">missing people</span>.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-4292">people missing</span>.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-4278">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
<span class="marked id-unique-4272">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-4276">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-4287">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-4273">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-4293">parked the train</span> and put the <span class="marked id-unique-4285">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local <span class="marked id-unique-4282">hotel for the night</span>.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-4298">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-4294">McGonigle told</span> La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-4274">centre of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-4284">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4297">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4298">Stephen</span> Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-4295">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-4270">train <span class="marked id-unique-4277">derailment</span>
and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The <span class="marked id-unique-4271">train was carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4273">crude oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. <span class="marked id-unique-4276">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-4287">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-4286">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4290">Maine, Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-4288">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-4289">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-4275">lakeside town</span> that is home to some 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4281">000 <span class="marked id-unique-4299">people</span>,
Lac-Megantic</span> is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-4356">photos and videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-4309">Lapointe
<span class="marked id-unique-4310">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4354">Saturday</span> night</span>.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-4311">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-4318">provincial police</span> Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-4357">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-4358">Facebook group</span>
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-4359">set up to help</span> people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-4324">reached by phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-4313">Red Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-4313">Red Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-4328">firefighters on the scene</span> and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-4327">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4360">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4361">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-4327">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-4362">assistance requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-4363">Friday night</span>.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she <span class="marked id-unique-4343">said. “When you think</span> of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by <span class="marked id-unique-4301">train derailment</span>

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a <span class="marked id-unique-4301">train derailment</span> in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-4327">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4360">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4361">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit <span class="marked id-unique-4307">Lac-Megantic,
Que</span>., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-4301">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least <span class="marked id-unique-4302">one <span class="marked id-unique-4314">person</span>.  The derailment</span>
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-4315">30
buildings</span> and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying <span class="marked id-unique-4308">crude
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-4323">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) <span class="marked id-unique-4317">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-4318">provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4355">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4310">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4354">Saturday</span> night</span>
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-4319">people who will be <span class="marked id-unique-4320">found</span> deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-4304">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4316">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4309">Lapointe</span>
said</span> during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported <span class="marked id-unique-4326">missing
than people</span> actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 <span class="marked id-unique-4328">firefighters were at
the scene</span>, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities <span class="marked id-unique-4310">said Saturday</span> that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-4362">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-4312">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-4339">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-4306">Atlantic</span>
Railway</span> Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-4337">Rail World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-4333">parent <span class="marked id-unique-4334">company</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-4312">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4339">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-4306">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4329">Edward Burkhardt</span>
said the <span class="marked id-unique-4341">train was <span class="marked id-unique-4336">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4342">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-4335">train got</span> away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-4345">brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-4346">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4347">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4330">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-4348">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-4305">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4325">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4338">away</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-4343">said</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-4321">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4331">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-4347">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4330">applied</span> on this train</span>." He said the <span class="marked id-unique-4341">train was parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-4332">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-4344">finished</span> his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-4340">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-4341">train</span> was parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late <span class="marked id-unique-4363">Friday night</span>. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-4312">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-4339">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the <span class="marked id-unique-4357">early morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-4355">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-4353">Maine, Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-4351">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-4352">New</span> Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-4349">owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-4350">800</span> kilometres</span>
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-4356">photos and videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-4323">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-4358">Facebook group</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-4359">set up to help</span> track down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-4324">reached by phone</span>.
The <span class="marked id-unique-4313">Red Cross</span> had set up a shelter <span class="marked id-unique-4311">Saturday afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-4322">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-4308">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
<span class="marked id-unique-4366">One person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-4367">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-4373">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-4374">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-4375">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," <span class="marked id-unique-4377">said Theberge</span>, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-4379">burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-4376">right</span> arm</span>.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-4366">one person</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-4381">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-4369">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4383">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-4384">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-4385">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-4386">people <span class="marked id-unique-4389">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-4382">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-4392">town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4393">000</span> people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-4395">intense <span class="marked id-unique-4396">heat</span>
as the towering</span> flames lit up the <span class="marked id-unique-4398">night sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-4400">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-4407">first explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-4415">Witnesses said</span>
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-4422">Late Saturday</span> firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-4423">cause of the accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-4416">railway's operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-4406">Edward Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-4424">Rail World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-4414">parent <span class="marked id-unique-4417">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-4378">Montreal</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-4427">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-4371">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4428">Railway</span>, said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4429">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-4430">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-4419">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4431">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-4413">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-4432">finished</span>
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-4433">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-4434">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4435">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4410">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-4436">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-4370">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-4397">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4425">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4404">Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-4390">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4411">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-4435">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4410">applied</span> on this train</span>." "<span class="marked id-unique-4437">We've had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-4426">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4380">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4438">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-4408">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4405">years</span>," he said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-4391">Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-4439">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4364">we've</span> blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-4365">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-4418">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4440">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-4441">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4442">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-4385">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-4443">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-4446">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-4447">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-4385">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-4451">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4452">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4453">Michel</span> Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-4412">Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-4454">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-4456">owns</span> a restaurant</span> in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-4457">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-4455">big <span class="marked id-unique-4458">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4401">like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-4402">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-4450">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-4459">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a <span class="marked id-unique-4409">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-4449">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4460">like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-4461">bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-4462">lot</span> of people</span> there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-4455">big <span class="marked id-unique-4463">explosion</span>. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-4464">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-4465">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-4466">population</span>."
Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-4403">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4468">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4469">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-4422">late
Saturday</span> nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-4367">train carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4374">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-4366">one person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4443">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-4395">intense <span class="marked id-unique-4396">heat</span> of towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-4398">night sky</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-4415">witnesses said</span>. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-4447">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-4429">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-4446">train</span> derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-4393">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-4375">lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-4392">town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4393">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-4384">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-4385">provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4451">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4452">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4453">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-4366">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

<span class="marked id-unique-4369">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4383">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-4384">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-4385">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4443">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-4386">people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-4389">found</span> deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-4400">missing, some
people</span> are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-4443">Police said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4407">first explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-4423">cause of the accident</span> was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-4416">railway's operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-4424">Rail World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-4414">parent
<span class="marked id-unique-4417">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-4378">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4427">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-4371">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4428">Railway</span>, said</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-4430">train had been <span class="marked id-unique-4419">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4431">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-4433">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-4434">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4435">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4410">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-4436">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-4370">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-4397">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4425">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4406">Edward <span class="marked id-unique-4404">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-4390">think</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-4411">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-4435">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4410">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-4430">train was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-4413">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-4432">finished</span> his run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-4437">We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-4426">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4380">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4438">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-4408">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4405">years</span>,"
he said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "<span class="marked id-unique-4391">Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-4439">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4364">we've</span>
blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-4382">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-4415">Witnesses said</span> the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-4457">early morning</span> sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-4373">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-4407">first explosion</span> went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," <span class="marked id-unique-4377">said Theberge</span>, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-4379">burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-4376">right</span> arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a <span class="marked id-unique-4409">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-4449">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4460">like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-4461">bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-4462">lot</span> of people</span> there," said <span class="marked id-unique-4412">Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-4454">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-4456">owns</span> a restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-4455">big
<span class="marked id-unique-4463">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-4464">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-4465">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-4466">population</span>."

Demers</span>, who fled his home, said the <span class="marked id-unique-4458">explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-4401">like</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-4402">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-4450">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-4459">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-4374">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-4403">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4468">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4469">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-4445">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-4365">train
<span class="marked id-unique-4381">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-4470">hope <span class="marked id-unique-4388">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4421">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4471">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-4472">homes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4448">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-4399">quickly</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-4473">people</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-4444">Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-4372">surrounding</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4474">areas</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4467">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4394">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4475">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-4476">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-4387">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-4477">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-4478">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-4420">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4479">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-4480">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4368">requested</span> by the province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-4378">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-4427">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-4418">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4442">Maine, Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4440">Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-4441">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-4367">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-4374">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-4378">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-4427">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-4371">Atlantic</span> Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as <span class="marked id-unique-4481">train explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
<span class="marked id-unique-4483">One person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-4485">freight train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4484">carrying oil</span> tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-4485">freight train</span>, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-4486">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-4487">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-4483">one person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-4490">town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4491">000</span> people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-4499">73-car train</span> was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-4482">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-4500">Joseph McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
<span class="marked id-unique-4496">Montreal Gazette</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4492">conductor stopped</span> the train outside
town just before midnight and <span class="marked id-unique-4493">locked the brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-4497">train <span class="marked id-unique-4501">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4495">loose</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-4489">said</span> McGonigle</span>. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-4497">train got</span> released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-4487">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-4494">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4503">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4504">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-4502">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-4494">prime minister</span> added: “We <span class="marked id-unique-4505">hope
<span class="marked id-unique-4488">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4498">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4506">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-4507">homes</span> safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Inferno In Quebec Town When <span class="marked id-unique-4481">Train Explodes</span>

At least <span class="marked id-unique-4483">one person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-4485">freight train</span> pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-4486">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The <span class="marked id-unique-4496">Montreal Gazette</span>:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-4500">Joseph R. McGonigle</span> confirmed to The Gazette early
<span class="marked id-unique-4487">Saturday afternoon</span> that shortly before midnight, the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-4492">conductor stopped</span> in nearby Nantes, <span class="marked id-unique-4493">locked the
brakes</span> and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-4486">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the <span class="marked id-unique-4497">train <span class="marked id-unique-4501">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4495">loose</span>,' <span class="marked id-unique-4489">said</span> McGonigle</span>. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-4499">73-car train</span> actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
<span class="marked id-unique-4484">carrying the oil</span> kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the <span class="marked id-unique-4490">town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4491">000</span> people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-4509">driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-4510">freight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4508">train</span> carrying</span> oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-4511">derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-4512">high</span> speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-4509">driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-4510">freight</span> train</span>, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-4513">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-4515">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-4517">subsequent explosions</span> that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-4519">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4520">000 people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-4528">Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-4529">said</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-4522">town</span> centre</span>, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-4516">Montreal,
Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving <span class="marked id-unique-4538">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-4539">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4540">Maine and Vermont</span>.
<span class="marked id-unique-4541">Joseph McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-4531">train got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-4514">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he <span class="marked id-unique-4536">said, should have been the only one</span> who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-4544">sure what <span class="marked id-unique-4535">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-4545">engineer</span> did <span class="marked id-unique-4546">everything</span> by the book</span>. He had <span class="marked id-unique-4547">parked
the <span class="marked id-unique-4518">train</span> and was <span class="marked id-unique-4537">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-4548">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-4549">somehow</span>,
the <span class="marked id-unique-4531">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4526">got</span> released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial <span class="marked id-unique-4542">police said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-4551">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-4552">last night</span> that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-4553">Billowing smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-4555">Worried
residents</span> watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-4556">friends
and <span class="marked id-unique-4533">loved</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4532">ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4557">may</span> have died</span>.  "We're <span class="marked id-unique-4534">told some <span class="marked id-unique-4543">people</span> are
missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4559">Michel Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-4527">Bernard Demers</span>, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion <span class="marked id-unique-4521">like an <span class="marked id-unique-4523">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-4530">said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-4554">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-4560">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down <span class="marked id-unique-4533">loved ones</span>
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with <span class="marked id-unique-4533">loved ones</span>," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-4525">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4561">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4562">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-4550">Thoughts & <span class="marked id-unique-4524">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-4563">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic</span>,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-4558">Horrible news</span>.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-4525">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-4509">driverless <span class="marked id-unique-4510">freight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4508">train</span> carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-4513">crude oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4511">derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-4512">high</span> speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 <span class="marked id-unique-4543">people were missing</span>, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-4517">subsequent explosions</span> combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-4553">billowing smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-4528">Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-4529">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4522">town</span> centre</span> was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4520">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-4515">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-4519">30 buildings</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-4522">town centre</span> were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-4520">000 people</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-4555">Worried residents</span> looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-4556">friends and
<span class="marked id-unique-4533">loved</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4532">ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4557">may</span> have died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-4542">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-4552">last night</span>.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-4514">centre of your town</span> almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-4559">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been <span class="marked id-unique-4534">told about people</span>
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-4525">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4561">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4562">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-4550">Thoughts & <span class="marked id-unique-4524">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-4563">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4558">Horrible news</span>."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-4516">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-4540">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-4538">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-4539">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-4541">Joseph McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-4551">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-4544">sure what <span class="marked id-unique-4535">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-4545">engineer</span> did
<span class="marked id-unique-4546">everything</span> by the book</span>," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-4547">parked the <span class="marked id-unique-4518">train</span> and was <span class="marked id-unique-4537">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-4548">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4549">Somehow</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4531">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4526">got</span> released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-4514">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-4527">Bernard Demers</span>, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, <span class="marked id-unique-4536">said one</span> of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-4521">like an <span class="marked id-unique-4523">atomic</span> bomb</span> detonating.

He <span class="marked id-unique-4530">said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-4554">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4560">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-4540">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
<span class="marked id-unique-5328">One person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-5329">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-5335">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-5336">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-5337">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," <span class="marked id-unique-5339">said Theberge</span>, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-5341">burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-5338">right</span> arm</span>.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-5328">one person</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-5343">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-5331">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-5345">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-5346">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-5347">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-5348">people <span class="marked id-unique-5351">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-5344">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-5354">town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-5355">000</span> people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-5357">intense <span class="marked id-unique-5358">heat</span>
as the towering</span> flames lit up the <span class="marked id-unique-5360">night sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-5362">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-5369">first explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-5377">Witnesses said</span>
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-5384">Late Saturday</span> firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5385">cause of the accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-5378">railway's operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-5368">Edward Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-5386">Rail World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-5376">parent <span class="marked id-unique-5379">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5340">Montreal</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-5389">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-5333">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5390">Railway</span>, said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5391">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-5392">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-5381">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5393">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-5375">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-5394">finished</span>
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-5395">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-5396">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5397">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5372">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-5398">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-5332">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-5359">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5387">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5366">Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-5352">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5373">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-5397">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5372">applied</span> on this train</span>." "<span class="marked id-unique-5399">We've had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-5388">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5342">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5400">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-5370">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5367">years</span>," he said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-5353">Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-5401">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5326">we've</span> blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-5327">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-5380">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5402">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-5403">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5404">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-5347">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-5405">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-5408">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-5409">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-5347">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-5413">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5414">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5415">Michel</span> Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-5374">Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-5416">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-5418">owns</span> a restaurant</span> in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-5419">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-5417">big <span class="marked id-unique-5420">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5363">like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-5364">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-5412">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-5421">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a <span class="marked id-unique-5371">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-5411">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5422">like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-5423">bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-5424">lot</span> of people</span> there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-5417">big <span class="marked id-unique-5425">explosion</span>. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-5426">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-5427">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-5428">population</span>."
Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-5365">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-5430">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5431">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-5407">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-5365">prime minister</span> added: “We <span class="marked id-unique-5432">hope
<span class="marked id-unique-5350">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5383">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5433">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-5434">homes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5410">safely</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5361">quickly</span>.

that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-5384">late
Saturday</span> nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-5329">train carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5336">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-5328">one person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5405">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-5357">intense <span class="marked id-unique-5358">heat</span> of towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-5360">night sky</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-5377">witnesses said</span>. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-5409">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-5391">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-5408">train</span> derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-5355">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-5337">lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-5354">town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-5355">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-5346">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-5347">provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5413">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5414">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5415">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-5328">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

<span class="marked id-unique-5331">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-5345">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-5346">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-5347">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5405">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-5348">people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-5351">found</span> deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-5362">missing, some
people</span> are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-5405">Police said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-5369">first explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5385">cause of the accident</span> was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-5378">railway's operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-5386">Rail World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-5376">parent
<span class="marked id-unique-5379">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5340">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5389">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-5333">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5390">Railway</span>, said</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-5392">train had been <span class="marked id-unique-5381">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5393">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-5395">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-5396">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5397">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5372">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-5398">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-5332">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-5359">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5387">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5368">Edward <span class="marked id-unique-5366">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-5352">think</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-5373">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-5397">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5372">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-5392">train was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-5375">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-5394">finished</span> his run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-5399">We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-5388">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5342">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5400">record</span> for these <span class="marked id-unique-5370">10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5367">years</span>,"
he said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "<span class="marked id-unique-5353">Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-5401">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5326">we've</span>
blown</span> it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-5344">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-5377">Witnesses said</span> the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-5419">early morning</span> sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-5335">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-5369">first explosion</span> went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," <span class="marked id-unique-5339">said Theberge</span>, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-5341">burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-5338">right</span> arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a <span class="marked id-unique-5371">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-5411">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5422">like</span> this with the <span class="marked id-unique-5423">bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-5424">lot</span> of people</span> there," said <span class="marked id-unique-5374">Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-5416">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-5418">owns</span> a restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-5417">big
<span class="marked id-unique-5425">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-5426">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-5427">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-5428">population</span>."

Demers</span>, who fled his home, said the <span class="marked id-unique-5420">explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-5363">like</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-5364">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-5412">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-5421">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-5336">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-5365">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-5430">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5431">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-5407">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-5327">train
<span class="marked id-unique-5343">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-5432">hope <span class="marked id-unique-5350">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5383">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5433">return</span> to their <span class="marked id-unique-5434">homes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5410">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-5361">quickly</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-5435">people</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-5406">Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5334">surrounding</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5436">areas</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5429">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5356">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5437">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-5438">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-5349">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-5439">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-5440">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-5382">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5441">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-5442">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-5330">requested</span> by the province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-5340">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-5389">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-5380">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5404">Maine, Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-5402">Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-5403">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-5329">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-5336">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-5340">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-5389">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5333">Atlantic</span> Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-9908">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of <span class="marked id-unique-9906">town.

LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-9910">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-9911">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-9913">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the <span class="marked id-unique-9909">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-9914">Guy Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-9915">expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-9916">people</span> found</span> deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-9912">Montreal,
<span class="marked id-unique-9918">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-9919">brakes
were properly</span> applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-9907">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-9917">track serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-9920">New Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-9923">parked
the train</span> and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial <span class="marked id-unique-9921">police said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-9926">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some <span class="marked id-unique-9922">people are
missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-9924">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9927">Stephen Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-9925">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
<span class="marked id-unique-9928">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-9907">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-9921">Police have said</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-9915">expect more <span class="marked id-unique-9916">people</span> to be found</span> dead
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-9908">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-9911">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-9906">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-9926">black smoke</span> into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-9922">people missing</span>.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-9914">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
<span class="marked id-unique-9910">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-9912">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-9923">parked the train</span> and put the <span class="marked id-unique-9919">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-9927">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-9924">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9927">Stephen Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-9925">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train <span class="marked id-unique-9909">derailment
and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The <span class="marked id-unique-9908">train was carrying</span> the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-9918">Maine & Atlantic</span> owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-9917">track serving</span> Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-9920">New Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-9913">lakeside town</span> that is home to some 6,000 <span class="marked id-unique-9928">people,
Lac-Megantic</span> is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-9930">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-9934">LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE</span>.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-9935">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-9938">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-9939">one person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-9932">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-9942">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-9943">Quebec
provincial</span> police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-9944">people <span class="marked id-unique-9945">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-9941">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-9953">Edward Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-9954">Rail World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-9949">parent <span class="marked id-unique-9950">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-9936">Montreal</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-9955">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-9933">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, said the <span class="marked id-unique-9956">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-9957">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-9952">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9958">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-9960">finished
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-9961">aren't <span class="marked id-unique-9962">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9963">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-9931">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-9947">run</span> away</span>," said Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-9946">think the <span class="marked id-unique-9964">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-9962">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9963">applied</span> on this train</span>." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-9929">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-9965">owns more than 800</span> kilometres of
track serving <span class="marked id-unique-9966">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-9967">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-9968">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-9951">train got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-9951">train got</span> released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial <span class="marked id-unique-9969">police said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
<span class="marked id-unique-9937">said Saturday</span> night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-9938">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-9970">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very

town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-9971">Facebook group</span>
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-9972">set up to help</span> people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-9940">Red Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper is set to visit <span class="marked id-unique-9934">Lac-Megantic,
Que</span>., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-9929">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least <span class="marked id-unique-9939">one person</span>.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-9941">30
buildings</span> and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying <span class="marked id-unique-9935">crude
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) <span class="marked id-unique-9943">Quebec provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-9937">said Saturday</span> night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-9944">people who will be <span class="marked id-unique-9945">found</span> deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-9932">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-9942">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 <span class="marked id-unique-9948">firefighters were at
the scene</span>, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-9973">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-9955">Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-9933">Atlantic</span>
Railway</span> Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-9954">Rail World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-9949">parent <span class="marked id-unique-9950">company</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-9936">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-9955">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-9953">Edward Burkhardt</span>
said the <span class="marked id-unique-9957">train was <span class="marked id-unique-9952">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9958">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-9951">train got</span> away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-9961">aren't <span class="marked id-unique-9962">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9963">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-9931">going to <span class="marked id-unique-9947">run</span>
away</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-9959">said. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-9946">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-9964">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-9962">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9963">applied</span> on this train</span>." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-9960">finished his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-9956">73-car train</span> was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late <span class="marked id-unique-9974">Friday night</span>. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-9936">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-9955">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the <span class="marked id-unique-9970">early morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-9969">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-9968">Maine, Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-9966">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-9967">New</span> Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-9965">owns more than 800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-9971">Facebook group</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-9972">set up to help</span> track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-9940">Red Cross</span> had set up a shelter <span class="marked id-unique-9938">Saturday afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-9980">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-9992">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-9993">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-9994">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-9991">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-9999">intense <span class="marked id-unique-10000">heat</span>
as the towering</span> flames lit up the <span class="marked id-unique-10002">night sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-10006">first explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10014">cause of the accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-10016">Edward Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail World, the <span class="marked id-unique-10008">parent <span class="marked id-unique-10009">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-9987">Montreal</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-10018">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-9981">Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10019">Railway</span>, said</span> the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-10020">train was <span class="marked id-unique-10011">parked</span>
uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-10015">engineer had finished</span>
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-10021">aren't <span class="marked id-unique-10022">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10023">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-9978">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-10001">run</span> away</span>," said Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-9996">think the <span class="marked id-unique-10024">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-10022">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10023">applied</span> on this train</span>." "We've had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-10017">good <span class="marked id-unique-10012">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10025">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10005">years," he said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-9997">Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-10026">think</span> we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-9975">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-10010">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10027">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-10028">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10029">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-9994">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-10030">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-10033">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-10034">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-9994">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-10036">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10037">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10038">Michel</span> Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-10013">Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-9982">owns</span> a restaurant</span> in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-9983">big explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10003">like an <span class="marked id-unique-10004">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-10039">Everybody was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a <span class="marked id-unique-10007">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-10040">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10041">like</span> this with the bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-10042">lot of people</span> there. It was a big <span class="marked id-unique-10043">explosion. It's
a catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-10031">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10035">Stephen Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-10032">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We <span class="marked id-unique-10044">hope
evacuees</span> can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-10045">homes safely</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10046">quickly. The
<span class="marked id-unique-10047">people</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-9984">surrounding areas</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-9998">rest
<span class="marked id-unique-10048">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-10049">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-9995">monitoring</span> the situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-10050">stand by <span class="marked id-unique-10051">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-10052">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-10053">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9979">requested</span> by
the province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-9976">train carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9986">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-9988">one person</span>. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-9999">intense <span class="marked id-unique-10000">heat</span> of towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-10002">night sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-10034">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-10033">train derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-9994">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-10036">police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10037">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10038">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-9988">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

<span class="marked id-unique-9980">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-9992">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-9993">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-9994">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10030">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-10030">Police said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10006">first explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10014">cause of the accident</span> was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-10008">parent
<span class="marked id-unique-10009">company</span> of Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10018">Maine & Atlantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10019">Railway, said</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-10020">train had been <span class="marked id-unique-10011">parked</span> uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-10021">aren't <span class="marked id-unique-10022">properly</span> applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-9978">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-10001">run</span> away</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-10016">Edward Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-9996">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-10024">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-10022">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10023">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-10015">engineer had finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very <span class="marked id-unique-10017">good <span class="marked id-unique-10012">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10025">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10005">years,"
he said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "<span class="marked id-unique-9997">Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-10026">think</span> we've</span>
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-9991">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-9985">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-10006">first explosion</span> went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-9989">burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-9990">right</span> arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a <span class="marked id-unique-10007">beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-10040">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10041">like</span> this with the bar</span>, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-10042">lot of people</span> there," said Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-10013">Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-9982">owns</span> a restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-9983">big
<span class="marked id-unique-10043">explosion</span>. It's a catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-10003">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-10004">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-10039">Everybody was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-9986">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-10031">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10035">Stephen Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-10032">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-9975">train
<span class="marked id-unique-9977">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-10044">hope evacuees</span> can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-10045">homes safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-10046">quickly. The <span class="marked id-unique-10047">people</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-9984">surrounding areas</span>
can <span class="marked id-unique-9998">rest <span class="marked id-unique-10048">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-10049">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-9995">monitoring</span> the
situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-10050">stand by <span class="marked id-unique-10051">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-10052">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-10053">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9979">requested</span> by the province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-9987">Montreal Maine</span> & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-10010">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10029">Maine, Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10027">Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-10028">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-9981">Atlantic Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as <span class="marked id-unique-10055">train explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-10056">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-10057">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-10058">one person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-10061">73-car train</span> was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-10054">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.

us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-10057">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said

a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-10063">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper, who

Inferno In Quebec Town When <span class="marked id-unique-10055">Train Explodes</span>

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-10056">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-10062">Joseph R. McGonigle</span> confirmed to The Gazette early
<span class="marked id-unique-10057">Saturday afternoon</span> that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-10056">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the <span class="marked id-unique-10060">train got</span> loose,' <span class="marked id-unique-10059">said McGonigle</span>. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-10061">73-car train</span> actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say <span class="marked id-unique-10058">one person</span> has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-10063">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper
has issued a statement:

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-10054">train
derailment</span>. We <span class="marked id-unique-10064">hope evacuees</span> can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-10065">homes

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-10066">train carrying</span> oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-10067">derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-10068">high</span> speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-10069">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-10072">subsequent explosions</span> that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-10073">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the <span class="marked id-unique-10075">town centre</span>, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-10071">Montreal,
Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving <span class="marked id-unique-10083">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-10084">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10085">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-10078">train got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-10070">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he <span class="marked id-unique-10082">said, should have been the only one</span> who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-10087">sure what <span class="marked id-unique-10081">happened</span>, but
the engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-10088">parked
the train</span> and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-10089">somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-10078">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10076">got</span> released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-10090">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-10091">last night</span> that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.

said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-10092">Billowing smoke</span> continued to fill

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-10066">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-10069">crude oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10067">derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-10068">high</span> speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 <span class="marked id-unique-10086">people were missing</span>, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-10072">subsequent explosions</span> combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-10092">billowing smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the <span class="marked id-unique-10075">town centre</span> was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-10073">30 buildings</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-10075">town centre</span> were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-10094">friends and
<span class="marked id-unique-10079">loved</span> ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10095">may have died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-10091">last night</span>.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-10096">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been <span class="marked id-unique-10080">told about people</span>
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-10071">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-10085">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-10083">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-10084">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-10090">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-10087">sure what <span class="marked id-unique-10081">happened</span>, but the engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-10088">parked the train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-10089">Somehow the <span class="marked id-unique-10078">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10076">got</span> released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-10070">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, <span class="marked id-unique-10082">said one</span> of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-10074">like an atomic</span> bomb detonating.

He <span class="marked id-unique-10077">said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-10093">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10097">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-10085">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-10358">help those who hadn't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10359">fled with them.  Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10360">said
the <span class="marked id-unique-10301">town</span> centre</span>, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-10361">many <span class="marked id-unique-10289">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10362">bars</span>, was

The <span class="marked id-unique-10415">cause</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-10416">accident</span> is itself turning</span> out to be

his run</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10441">Somehow it headed</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-10368">town <span class="marked id-unique-10442">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-10444">driver</span>.

that all the <span class="marked id-unique-10482">cars</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-10483">secured</span>. He then <span class="marked id-unique-10414">checked</span> into a

before leaving</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10492">train for the <span class="marked id-unique-10109">night</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-10494">conductor</span>,
he <span class="marked id-unique-10458">said</span>, should have been the only one</span> who could set
the <span class="marked id-unique-10495">train in <span class="marked id-unique-10496">motion</span>.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-10499">sure</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-10447">happened</span>, but

the <span class="marked id-unique-10130">ground</span> shake</span>.  But it <span class="marked id-unique-10179">wasn't until the driverless</span>

"It was like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-10214">apocalyptic vision</span>," said Theberge, 44,
who <span class="marked id-unique-10191">suffered <span class="marked id-unique-10215">burns</span> to his <span class="marked id-unique-10217">right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10110">arm</span>.  He and others</span> on the

until</span> the heat</span> from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-10354">derailment and 4:30</span> a.m., <span class="marked id-unique-10317">scorched his arm</span>. He

<span class="marked id-unique-10358">help those who hadn't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10359">fled with them.  Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10360">said
the <span class="marked id-unique-10301">town</span> centre</span>, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-10361">many <span class="marked id-unique-10289">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10362">bars</span>, was

The <span class="marked id-unique-10363">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10372">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-10375">intense</span> that Roger</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10115">Beauchesne,

from the heat</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-10384">Beauchesne said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10385">municipal <span class="marked id-unique-10149">library</span>,

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-10653">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-10662">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-10663">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-10666">right arm</span>.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-10665">one person</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-10654">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-10657">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10668">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-10669">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-10670">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-10671">people <span class="marked id-unique-10673">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-10667">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-10677">intense <span class="marked id-unique-10678">heat</span>
as the towering</span> flames lit up the <span class="marked id-unique-10680">night sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-10684">first explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-10688">Rail World</span>, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-10664">Montreal,
<span class="marked id-unique-10689">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-10658">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, said the <span class="marked id-unique-10690">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-10691">train</span> was parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10692">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span> after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-10693">finished
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-10694">properly <span class="marked id-unique-10695">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-10655">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-10679">run</span> away</span>," said Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-10674">think the <span class="marked id-unique-10696">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-10694">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10695">applied</span> on this train</span>." "We've had a very
good <span class="marked id-unique-10686">safety <span class="marked id-unique-10697">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10683">years," he said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-10675">Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-10698">think</span> we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-10652">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-10685">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10699">Quebec, New</span> Brunswick, <span class="marked id-unique-10700">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-10670">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-10701">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-10704">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-10706">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-10670">provincial police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10708">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10709">Michel</span> Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-10687">Demers, who owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-10710">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-10659">big explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10681">like an <span class="marked id-unique-10682">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-10705">hot. ... Everybody</span> was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-10711">evening like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-10712">lot of people</span> there. It was a big <span class="marked id-unique-10713">explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-10661">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-10702">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10707">Stephen Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-10703">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-10714">homes <span class="marked id-unique-10715">safely</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10716">quickly</span>. The
<span class="marked id-unique-10717">people</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10660">surrounding areas</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-10676">rest
<span class="marked id-unique-10718">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-10719">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-10672">monitoring</span> the situation</span> and
we stand by <span class="marked id-unique-10720">ready to <span class="marked id-unique-10721">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-10722">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10656">requested</span> by
the province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-10663">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-10665">one person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-10701">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-10677">intense <span class="marked id-unique-10678">heat</span> of towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the <span class="marked id-unique-10680">night sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-10706">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-10690">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-10704">train</span> derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-10669">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-10670">provincial</span> police</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10708">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10709">Michel</span> Brunet</span> confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-10665">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

<span class="marked id-unique-10657">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-10668">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-10669">Quebec provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10701">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-10671">people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-10673">found</span> deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-10701">Police said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-10684">first explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-10688">Rail World</span> Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-10664">Montreal, Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-10658">Atlantic Railway</span>, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-10691">train had been parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10692">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-10694">properly <span class="marked id-unique-10695">applied</span> on a train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-10655">going
to <span class="marked id-unique-10679">run</span> away</span>," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-10674">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-10696">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-10694">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10695">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-10691">train was parked</span> because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-10693">finished his run</span>.

"We've had a very good <span class="marked id-unique-10686">safety <span class="marked id-unique-10697">record</span> for these 10</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10683">years,"
he said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "<span class="marked id-unique-10675">Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-10698">think</span> we've</span>
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-10667">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-10710">early morning</span> sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-10662">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-10684">first explosion</span> went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his <span class="marked id-unique-10666">right arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-10711">evening like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-10712">lot of people</span> there," said Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-10687">Demers, who
owns</span> a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-10659">big
<span class="marked id-unique-10713">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-10661">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-10681">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-10682">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-10705">hot. ... Everybody</span> was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-10663">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-10702">Prime Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10707">Stephen Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-10703">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-10652">train
<span class="marked id-unique-10654">derailment</span> and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-10714">homes <span class="marked id-unique-10715">safely</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-10716">quickly</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-10717">people</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-10660">surrounding areas</span>
can <span class="marked id-unique-10676">rest <span class="marked id-unique-10718">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-10719">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-10672">monitoring</span> the
situation</span> and we stand by <span class="marked id-unique-10720">ready to <span class="marked id-unique-10721">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-10722">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-10656">requested</span> by the province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-10689">Maine & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-10685">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-10700">Maine, Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-10699">Quebec and
New</span> Brunswick.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-10653">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-10663">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-10664">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-10689">Maine</span> and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

One <span class="marked id-unique-14813">dead</span>, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-14813">dead</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-14799">driverless</span>
freight train <span class="marked id-unique-14816">carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-14797">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-14799">driverless</span>
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-14767">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-14777">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-14803">patio</span>.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-14769">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-14803">patio</span> fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-14759">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-14775">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-14815">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14778">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-14809">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-14801">destroyed</span> 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-14800">businesses</span> and left <span class="marked id-unique-14805">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-14786">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-14804">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-14771">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-14764">crowded</span> when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-14781">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-14774">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-14811">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
<span class="marked id-unique-14796">fires</span>, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-14768">railway's</span> operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-14790">runaway</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-14779">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-14812">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-14798">Somehow</span> it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-14765">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-14763">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-14795">zone</span>: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-14791">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-14766">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-14785">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14788">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-14817">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-14760">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-14807">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-14808">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-14812">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-14798">somehow</span>,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-14808">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-14787">Canada</span> is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-14806">black</span> box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-14797">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-14810">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-14776">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a <span class="marked id-unique-14770">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke <span class="marked id-unique-14772">continued</span> to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-14806">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-14811">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-14818">trains</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14816">carrying</span>
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-14800">businesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14801">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-14807">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-14794">Early</span> this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-14773">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small <span class="marked id-unique-14793">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-14807">set</span> up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-14762">reached</span> by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a <span class="marked id-unique-14802">local</span> school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them <span class="marked id-unique-14792">get</span>
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-14761">continue</span> to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-14811">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14819">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-14780">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14784">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-14782">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-14789">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular <span class="marked id-unique-14802">local</span> singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-14804">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-14814">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14783">Press</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-14787">Canada</span> train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll <span class="marked id-unique-14807">set</span> to rise

Deaths feared in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-14773">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-14813">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-14790">runaway</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-14816">carrying</span> light crude oil exploded
in the <span class="marked id-unique-14814">Canadian</span> town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-14809">fireball</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14806">black</span> smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-14815">air</span>,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-14805">Dozens</span> of buildings were <span class="marked id-unique-14801">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-14786">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for <span class="marked id-unique-14805">dozens</span> of missing people.

The <span class="marked id-unique-14818">train's</span> cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-14794">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-14791">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-14793">village</span> before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-14776">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14767">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-14799">driverless</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-14762">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-14797">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
<span class="marked id-unique-14761">continue</span> at dawn.

<span class="marked id-unique-14802">Local</span> media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-14769">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14778">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 <span class="marked id-unique-14811">firefighters</span> have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-14810">blaze</span>, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-14772">continued</span> for more than 24 hours.

<span class="marked id-unique-14811">Firefighters</span> from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-14764">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


<span class="marked id-unique-14811">Firefighters</span> fought the <span class="marked id-unique-14810">blaze</span> for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-14803">patio</span> of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-14759">lucky</span> to escape and feared for
those <span class="marked id-unique-14804">inside</span> the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
<span class="marked id-unique-14783">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-14774">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-14765">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-14771">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14770">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the <span class="marked id-unique-14793">village</span> of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-14763">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-14768">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-14779">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-14812">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a <span class="marked id-unique-14802">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14760">hotel</span> for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-14798">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


<span class="marked id-unique-14814">Canadian</span> PM <span class="marked id-unique-14819">Stephen</span> Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-14808">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-14809">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-14800">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-14795">zone</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-14807">set</span> up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-14801">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-14792">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14819">Stephen</span> Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-14782">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-14780">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14784">prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-14775">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14796">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-14818">train's</span> cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-14781">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-14807">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the <span class="marked id-unique-14815">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-14789">added</span>.

The train was <span class="marked id-unique-14816">carrying</span> the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track <span class="marked id-unique-14766">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-14817">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14785">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14788">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-14777">lakeside</span> town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with <span class="marked id-unique-14817">Vermont</span> and

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-14834">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-14830">high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with <span class="marked id-unique-14834">tankers</span> of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-14835">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-14877">afternoon</span> police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-14858">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by <span class="marked id-unique-14881">late</span> evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14849">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-14841">deceased</span>." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-14821">shock</span> wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
<span class="marked id-unique-14880">homes</span>, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-14876">businesses</span> and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-14846">tracks</span> that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-14867">kilometre</span> away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-14875">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-14864">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-14860">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-14833">two</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14839">kilometres</span> from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-14852">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-14846">tracks</span>, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-14881">Late</span> Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-14842">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-14850">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14865">Burkhardt</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14854">chief</span>
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-14831">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-14838">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-14851">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-14832">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-14840">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-14870">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-14844">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14871">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14866">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-14872">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-14870">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-14865">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-14871">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14866">applied</span> on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-14857">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-14873">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-14845">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14839">kilometres</span> of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-14853">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14856">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-14861">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the

before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-14882">happened</span>, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-14882">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-14855">Canada</span> is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-14823">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14820">videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had <span class="marked id-unique-14847">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-14829">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing <span class="marked id-unique-14878">smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-14877">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black <span class="marked id-unique-14878">smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
<span class="marked id-unique-14867">kilometre</span> away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-14862">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-14876">businesses</span> destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment

Bernard Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-14873">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-14848">morning</span> (there was)

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there

Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very

town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-14826">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14824">group</span>
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-14864">help</span> people track down loved ones
who <span class="marked id-unique-14869">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-14827">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-14828">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-14879">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14868">Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-14879">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14868">Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14863">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-14880">homes</span> safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-14837">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-14843">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14836">requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-14825">Friday</span> night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't <span class="marked id-unique-14878">smoke</span>, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in <span class="marked id-unique-14821">shock</span> following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14863">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many <span class="marked id-unique-14880">homes</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-14876">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-14878">Smoke</span> rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-14855">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-14858">death</span> toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-14841">deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14849">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews <span class="marked id-unique-14869">couldn't</span> reach a section
of the town due to fears that <span class="marked id-unique-14875">five</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-14834">tankers</span> cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-14875">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14834">tankers</span> with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-14843">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-14836">requested</span> any
<span class="marked id-unique-14864">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-14854">chief</span> Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-14882">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-14837">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which <span class="marked id-unique-14873">owns</span> the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-14874">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-14831">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-14838">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-14850">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14865">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-14832">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-14865">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-14844">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14871">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14866">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-14872">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14870">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-14871">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14866">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-14840">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-14870">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-14851">73-car</span> train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-14822">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-14829">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-14881">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14825">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-14833">two</span>
town centres are about 12 <span class="marked id-unique-14839">kilometres</span> apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-14874">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-14848">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-14847">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14835">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-14846">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-14862">train's</span> engine was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-14867">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-14861">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14853">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14856">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14873">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-14845">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14839">kilometres</span>
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-14846">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-14860">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-14830">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-14823">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14820">videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of <span class="marked id-unique-14878">smoke</span> emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-14857">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular <span class="marked id-unique-14859">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their <span class="marked id-unique-14880">homes</span>, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-14826">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14824">group</span> was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-14864">help</span> track down
residents who <span class="marked id-unique-14869">couldn't</span> immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-14827">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-14828">phone</span>.
The <span class="marked id-unique-14879">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14868">Cross</span> had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-14877">afternoon</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-14852">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-14986">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-14968">First</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14982">Bernard</span> Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-14994">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-14994">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-14947">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-14990">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-14907">burns</span> to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-14924">others</span> on the
patio <span class="marked id-unique-14993">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-14970">death</span> of one <span class="marked id-unique-14986">person</span> in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-14944">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-14971">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-14995">evening</span>, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14948">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-14980">expect</span> there
will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-14979">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14931">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-14958">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-14950">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-14960">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14915">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-14992">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-14884">towering</span> flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-14976">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows <span class="marked id-unique-14885">three</span> of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-14968">first</span> explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-14978">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-14990">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-14993">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many <span class="marked id-unique-14977">popular</span> bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-14965">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-14992">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-14913">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-14953">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-14934">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-14964">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-14930">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-14926">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-14935">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-14905">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-14920">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14895">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-14949">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14981">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-14910">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-14923">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-14951">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-14912">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-14928">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-14984">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-14911">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-14941">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14985">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14983">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-14984">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-14981">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-14985">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14983">applied</span> on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-14972">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-14900">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-14892">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-14989">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-14972">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14908">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-14967">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-14988">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-14943">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-14916">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-14957">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14962">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-14973">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-14890">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-14959">everything</span> by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-14963">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-14945">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-14904">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-14938">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-14932">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-14976">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a <span class="marked id-unique-14991">lot</span> of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-14898">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-14974">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-14961">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14925">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14936">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-14982">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14969">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-14988">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-14978">home</span>.  "<span class="marked id-unique-14987">Early</span> this <span class="marked id-unique-14946">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-14939">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14937">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-14927">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-14942">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-14995">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-14991">lot</span> of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-14933">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-14914">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-14894">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-14969">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-14989">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-14901">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-14888">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-14897">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-14883">want</span> us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14975">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-14906">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-14902">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-14952">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14956">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-14954">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-14966">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-14929">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-14918">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-14917">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-14886">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-14891">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14909">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-14899">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-14896">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14889">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-14887">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-14893">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14922">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-14940">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14919">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-14921">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-14977">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-14903">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-14932">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14935">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-14986">person</span>. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-14970">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-14992">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-14884">towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-14976">sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-14938">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-14897">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-14951">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-14947">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-14960">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14925">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14936">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-14986">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-14961">died</span>. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-14924">others</span>
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14948">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-14903">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14883">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-14980">expect</span> we'll have other people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-14979">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14931">deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-14901">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-14913">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14885">three</span> times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-14977">popular</span> area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-14968">first</span> explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-14905">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-14920">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14895">operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-14910">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-14923">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-14912">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-14941">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14985">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14983">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-14984">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-14949">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14981">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-14985">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14983">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-14981">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-14928">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-14984">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-14972">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-14900">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-14892">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-14989">years</span>,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-14972">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14908">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-14964">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-14990">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-14898">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-14987">early</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14946">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14976">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-14982">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the <span class="marked id-unique-14977">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-14968">first</span> explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-14945">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-14907">burns</span>
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-14963">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-14950">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-14890">security</span> perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-14995">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-14991">lot</span> of people there," said <span class="marked id-unique-14982">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14969">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-14988">owns</span> a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-14965">blast</span> site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-14933">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-14914">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-14894">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-14969">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-14993">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-14978">home</span>, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-14939">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14937">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14927">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-14942">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-14994">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-14978">home</span> after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-14958">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-14926">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-14930">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14959">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-14953">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14966">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-14971">air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-14915">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14975">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-14902">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-14954">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-14952">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14956">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-14944">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-14929">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-14918">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-14917">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-14886">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-14891">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14909">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-14899">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-14896">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-14889">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-14887">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-14893">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14922">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-14940">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14919">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-14921">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company <span class="marked id-unique-14988">owns</span> more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-14943">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-14916">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-14973">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-14957">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14962">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-14906">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-14911">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-14967">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-14934">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-14904">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-14974">trains</span>
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-14888">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-14998">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-15028">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-15032">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-15032">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
<span class="marked id-unique-15000">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-15008">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-15033">afternoon</span> police
<span class="marked id-unique-15022">confirmed</span> the death of one <span class="marked id-unique-15028">person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-15031">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-15017">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-15006">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-15031">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-15019">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the <span class="marked id-unique-15023">accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-15036">Rail</span> World, the parent <span class="marked id-unique-15035">company</span> of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-15013">73-car</span> train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-15029">zone</span>: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-15005">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-15027">Gazette</span> the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-14996">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-15026">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14997">locked</span> the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then <span class="marked id-unique-14999">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-15024">Sometime</span> after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-15010">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-15003">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-15004">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, <span class="marked id-unique-15022">confirmed</span> last night that it had received
a call <span class="marked id-unique-15024">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-15026">midnight</span> about a <span class="marked id-unique-15030">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-15033">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-15020">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-15012">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-15025">small</span> village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-15001">160</span> firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-15021">Stephen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15034">Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-15014">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-15016">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-15015">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-15018">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-15011">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-15009">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15007">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-15002">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

<span class="marked id-unique-15006">Inferno</span> In Quebec Town When Train <span class="marked id-unique-14998">Explodes</span>

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-15028">person</span> has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-15032">freight</span> train pulling tank cars full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a <span class="marked id-unique-15025">small</span> Quebec town about <span class="marked id-unique-15001">160</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-15017">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities <span class="marked id-unique-15022">confirmed</span> the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war <span class="marked id-unique-15029">zone</span>.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not <span class="marked id-unique-15003">report</span> other injuries.

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-15027">Gazette</span>:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-15012">morning</span> was unmanned when it

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-15115">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15114">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-15062">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15111">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-15115">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15114">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-15105">saw</span> and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-15046">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15078">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-15093">right</span> arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-15077">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames <span class="marked id-unique-15107">hundreds</span> of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-15085">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 <span class="marked id-unique-15102">buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-15113">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-15086">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15066">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-15107">Hundreds</span> of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-15061">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass <span class="marked id-unique-15093">right</span> through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
<span class="marked id-unique-15108">eyewitness</span> accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, <span class="marked id-unique-15047">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-15040">unable</span> to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-15113">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe <span class="marked id-unique-15052">distance</span> away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-15048">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-15100">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-15096">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-15064">crowded</span> when the train flew off the <span class="marked id-unique-15045">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-15049">initial</span> blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-15080">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the <span class="marked id-unique-15102">buildings</span>
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-15090">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-15071">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-15069">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-15092">runaway</span>.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-15112">Somehow</span> it headed into town without a <span class="marked id-unique-15063">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-15109">going</span>
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-15097">We've</span> had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-15097">we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-15110">zone</span>: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-15083">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15088">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-15060">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-15039">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-15042">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-15054">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-15037">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-15043">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-15112">somehow</span>,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-15044">released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety <span class="marked id-unique-15055">Board</span> of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-15111">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting <span class="marked id-unique-15108">eyewitness</span> accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-15058">report</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-15089">blaze</span> had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-15084">last</span> night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-15074">Billowing</span> smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-15106">never</span> allow <span class="marked id-unique-15098">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes <span class="marked id-unique-15056">absolutely</span>
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-15104">Worried</span>
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-15101">friends</span>
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-15087">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15068">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15072">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-15053">can't</span> tell you at the moment
whether there are any <span class="marked id-unique-15038">victims</span> or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-15075">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15073">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-15070">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-15076">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-15095">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-15103">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15065">terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-15100">help</span> people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-15059">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the <span class="marked id-unique-15116">scene</span> and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-15099">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on <span class="marked id-unique-15041">Twitter</span>.  “<span class="marked id-unique-15079">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-15082">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-15050">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-15051">Horrible</span> news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-15081">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-15091">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the <span class="marked id-unique-15067">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-15057">six</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15101">friends</span> at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-15094">Canadian</span> Press

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-15046">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15094">Canadian</span> town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-15115">driverless</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15114">freight</span> train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-15107">hundreds</span> of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-15062">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15111">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-15092">runaway</span> train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the <span class="marked id-unique-15045">rails</span> shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-15077">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-15085">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-15074">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-15096">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-15064">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-15078">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-15086">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 <span class="marked id-unique-15102">buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-15061">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-15057">six</span>
loud <span class="marked id-unique-15090">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-15110">zone</span> as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-15089">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-15104">Worried</span> residents looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-15101">friends</span> and
loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-15087">died</span> in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-15040">unable</span>
to reach family or <span class="marked id-unique-15101">friends</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15059">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-15084">last</span> night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are <span class="marked id-unique-15104">worried</span>
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-15053">can't</span> give out any information on what's happening
<span class="marked id-unique-15093">right</span> now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-15091">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-15109">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-15068">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15072">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-15056">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15048">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-15038">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-15097">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-15099">Stephen</span> Harper took to <span class="marked id-unique-15041">Twitter</span> to release
an <span class="marked id-unique-15049">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15081">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-15079">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-15082">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-15050">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic. <span class="marked id-unique-15051">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-15083">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15088">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-15039">vice-president</span> of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-15060">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on <span class="marked id-unique-15055">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-15052">distance</span> from the
town during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-15063">driver</span> shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-15042">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-15054">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-15037">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-15043">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-15112">Somehow</span> the train got <span class="marked id-unique-15044">released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to <span class="marked id-unique-15102">buildings</span> but
we haven't got a full <span class="marked id-unique-15058">report</span> yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-15108">Eyewitness</span> Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-15113">left</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-15103">bar</span> when he <span class="marked id-unique-15105">saw</span> the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-15106">never</span> seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-15105">saw</span> the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the <span class="marked id-unique-15116">scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-15065">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-15097">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15106">never</span> seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-15069">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-15071">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-15047">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-15075">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15073">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-15070">hot</span>. Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-15076">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-15098">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-15093">Right</span> now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-15080">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-15066">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-15100">help</span> deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-15100">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an <span class="marked id-unique-15095">area</span> popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-15067">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

in the <span class="marked id-unique-15334">heart</span> of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-15230">heard</span> the
now <span class="marked id-unique-15232">haunting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15178">rattle</span> of an <span class="marked id-unique-15293">approaching</span> train. Then he felt
the <span class="marked id-unique-15336">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15162">shake</span>.  But it <span class="marked id-unique-15126">wasn't</span> until the driverless

<span class="marked id-unique-15320">picturesque</span> lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were <span class="marked id-unique-15255">enjoying</span> a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-15148">summer's</span> night on the patio.
"It was like an <span class="marked id-unique-15294">apocalyptic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15129">vision</span>," said Theberge, <span class="marked id-unique-15303">44</span>,
who <span class="marked id-unique-15149">suffered</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15404">burns</span> to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-15326">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that <span class="marked id-unique-15160">shot</span> flames <span class="marked id-unique-15387">hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15205">metres</span>
into the air and <span class="marked id-unique-15218">laid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15125">waste</span> to downtown Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-15226">However</span>, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was <span class="marked id-unique-15316">saying</span> authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-15314">shock</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15123">wave</span> from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, <span class="marked id-unique-15235">gutted</span> downtown businesses and left dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-15191">people
- possibly</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-15300">60 - unaccounted</span> for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of <span class="marked id-unique-15417">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-15387">Hundreds</span> of
people had to <span class="marked id-unique-15165">scramble</span> for safety, <span class="marked id-unique-15241">fleeing</span> the intense heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-15359">towering</span> flames <span class="marked id-unique-15213">lit</span> up the night sky.  Theberge,
who <span class="marked id-unique-15119">works</span> at the Musi-Cafe, said he <span class="marked id-unique-15220">knows</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15360">three</span> of the
missing people: <span class="marked id-unique-15245">fellow</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15342">employees</span> who haven't <span class="marked id-unique-15172">responded</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-15174">repeated</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15144">telephone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15280">calls</span>. While he and his <span class="marked id-unique-15192">pals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15252">escaped</span>,
those inside the restaurant may have been <span class="marked id-unique-15135">trapped</span> in an
<span class="marked id-unique-15386">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, <span class="marked id-unique-15349">beside</span> the railway tracks that
<span class="marked id-unique-15322">pass</span> right through the <span class="marked id-unique-15334">heart</span> of downtown, is <span class="marked id-unique-15256">emerging</span> in
<span class="marked id-unique-15394">eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15352">accounts</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-15336">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15117">zero</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15266">deadly</span> explosion.
<span class="marked id-unique-15118">Yannick</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15337">Gagne</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15323">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-15310">unable</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15271">contact</span> some <span class="marked id-unique-15342">employees</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-15337">Gagne</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-15180">radio</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15153">station</span> he left the restaurant about <span class="marked id-unique-15354">20</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15204">minutes</span> before the
first explosion and he could <span class="marked id-unique-15246">feel</span> the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-15384">kilometre</span> away at his home.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-15229">hopped</span> on his <span class="marked id-unique-15285">bicycle</span>
and got to what he <span class="marked id-unique-15140">thought</span> was a <span class="marked id-unique-15168">safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15343">distance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15289">away -
until</span> the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., <span class="marked id-unique-15166">scorched</span> his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-15324">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
help those who <span class="marked id-unique-15234">hadn't</span> fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-15399">crowded</span> when the train <span class="marked id-unique-15240">flew</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-15319">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-15329">initial</span> blast was so intense that <span class="marked id-unique-15170">Roger</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15406">Beauchesne</span>,
who was outside his <span class="marked id-unique-15228">house</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15412">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take <span class="marked id-unique-15269">cover</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15350">behind</span> his car to <span class="marked id-unique-15182">protect</span> himself
from the heat.  <span class="marked id-unique-15406">Beauchesne</span> said the <span class="marked id-unique-15197">municipal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15214">library</span>,
which is <span class="marked id-unique-15349">beside</span> the railway tracks, was <span class="marked id-unique-15296">among</span> the buildings
<span class="marked id-unique-15263">demolished</span> by the blasts, <span class="marked id-unique-15297">along</span> with Dollarama and the
Metro <span class="marked id-unique-15236">grocery</span>. Late Saturday firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-15291">assisted</span> by
<span class="marked id-unique-15156">specialists</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15131">Ultramar</span> were still <span class="marked id-unique-15288">battling</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15188">persistent</span>
fires, burning <span class="marked id-unique-15261">despite</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-15151">steady</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15257">drizzle</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15402">cause</span> of the accident is itself <span class="marked id-unique-15133">turning</span> out to be
<span class="marked id-unique-15150">stranger</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-15244">fiction</span>. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-15423">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15377">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
<span class="marked id-unique-15250">executive</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15409">World</span>, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-15411">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-15416">Somehow</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-15231">headed</span> into town <span class="marked id-unique-15410">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-15396">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-15391">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-15372">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-15408">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think we've <span class="marked id-unique-15405">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on <span class="marked id-unique-15248">fatal</span> train derailment

The <span class="marked id-unique-15305">10-year-old</span> railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-15418">serving</span> Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-15385">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-15309">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-15393">Gazette</span> the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-15313">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-15381">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15328">locked</span> the brakes, <span class="marked id-unique-15253">ensuring</span>
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-15315">secured</span>. He then <span class="marked id-unique-15345">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-15332">hotel</span> for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-15364">Sometime</span> after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It <span class="marked id-unique-15134">travelled</span> under
its own <span class="marked id-unique-15225">inertia</span> to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-15368">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15207">mechanisms</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15184">prevent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15146">tampering</span> with
the train, and the conductor had <span class="marked id-unique-15259">done</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15183">proper</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15277">checks</span>
before <span class="marked id-unique-15216">leaving</span> the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in <span class="marked id-unique-15199">motion</span>.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-15312">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-15347">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-15306">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-15317">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-15416">somehow</span>,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-15318">released</span>," McGonigle told <span class="marked id-unique-15171">Reuters</span>.
"<span class="marked id-unique-15142">That's</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-15273">confuses</span> us. How did this <span class="marked id-unique-15233">happen</span>? There are
many <span class="marked id-unique-15249">fail-safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15203">modes</span>. How this happened is just <span class="marked id-unique-15286">beyond</span>
us." The <span class="marked id-unique-15136">Transportation</span> Safety <span class="marked id-unique-15348">Board</span> of Canada is <span class="marked id-unique-15327">looking</span>
for the black <span class="marked id-unique-15283">box</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15274">confirm</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15260">direction</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15415">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are <span class="marked id-unique-15272">considering</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-15185">possible</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15268">criminal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15221">investigation</span>.  Lt. Lapointe said
<span class="marked id-unique-15193">officers</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-15276">collecting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15394">eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15352">accounts</span> as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-15321">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15307">videos</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15279">cellphones</span>.  They are also <span class="marked id-unique-15327">looking</span>
into a <span class="marked id-unique-15371">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-15379">Nantes</span> fire <span class="marked id-unique-15398">department</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-15161">short</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15258">drive</span> from town, confirmed last night that it had <span class="marked id-unique-15176">received</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-15281">call</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15364">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-15381">midnight</span> about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just <span class="marked id-unique-15316">saying</span> it's one of the <span class="marked id-unique-15186">possibilities</span>," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to <span class="marked id-unique-15242">fill</span>
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and <span class="marked id-unique-15211">lots</span> of firefighters. This is so <span class="marked id-unique-15169">saddening</span>
to see," said <span class="marked id-unique-15215">Leonard</span> Bedard, <span class="marked id-unique-15299">80</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-15383">lives</span> about a
<span class="marked id-unique-15384">kilometre</span> away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-15378">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15298">allow</span> trains carrying
that <span class="marked id-unique-15198">much</span> oil to <span class="marked id-unique-15322">pass</span> through towns. It <span class="marked id-unique-15325">makes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15353">absolutely</span>
no <span class="marked id-unique-15164">sense</span>, and it <span class="marked id-unique-15325">makes</span> me <span class="marked id-unique-15295">angry</span>."

Bedard said that is "<span class="marked id-unique-15200">mostly</span> businesses destroyed, but about
30 to <span class="marked id-unique-15304">40</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15227">houses</span> as well. I hope they <span class="marked id-unique-15177">rebuild</span>." <span class="marked id-unique-15356">Worried</span>
residents <span class="marked id-unique-15124">watched</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15350">behind</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15189">perimeters</span> set up by
authorities, <span class="marked id-unique-15159">sick</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-15247">fear</span> that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on <span class="marked id-unique-15130">vacation</span>,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told <span class="marked id-unique-15173">reporters</span>. "We're
<span class="marked id-unique-15278">checking</span> all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-15346">can't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15143">tell</span> you at the <span class="marked id-unique-15202">moment</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15122">whether</span> there are any <span class="marked id-unique-15308">victims</span> or people who are <span class="marked id-unique-15224">injured</span>."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
<span class="marked id-unique-15341">evacuated</span> from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was <span class="marked id-unique-15282">bustling</span> as the train <span class="marked id-unique-15331">hurtled</span> in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15413">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-15375">population</span>."
Demers, who has <span class="marked id-unique-15212">lived</span> in Lac-Megantic for <span class="marked id-unique-15302">45</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15408">years</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-15262">describes</span> it as a "<span class="marked id-unique-15195">nice</span> town." "Everybody is very
<span class="marked id-unique-15237">friendly</span> ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-15365">small</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15358">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it <span class="marked id-unique-15121">won't</span> be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-15339">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15335">group</span>
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who <span class="marked id-unique-15401">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-15374">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15376">phone</span>.  About <span class="marked id-unique-15301">450</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-15341">evacuated</span> residents are <span class="marked id-unique-15152">staying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-15187">Polyvalente</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15201">Montignac</span>,
a local <span class="marked id-unique-15167">school</span>, where <span class="marked id-unique-15354">20</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15127">volunteers</span> from the Red <span class="marked id-unique-15400">Cross</span>
are <span class="marked id-unique-15389">helping</span> out.  "For now we're <span class="marked id-unique-15389">helping</span> them get
<span class="marked id-unique-15163">settled</span> in, <span class="marked id-unique-15181">providing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15239">food</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15287">beds</span>, as well as <span class="marked id-unique-15389">helping</span>
them <span class="marked id-unique-15392">getting</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-15138">touch</span> with loved ones," said Red <span class="marked id-unique-15400">Cross</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15363">spokeswoman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15196">Myriam</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15209">Marotte</span>. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-15344">continue</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15292">assist</span>
as <span class="marked id-unique-15382">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-15357">want</span> us to." <span class="marked id-unique-15406">Beauchesne</span> said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-15355">160</span> firefighters on the scene and <span class="marked id-unique-15141">there's</span>
a "<span class="marked id-unique-15145">team</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15155">spirit</span>" in the town and “<span class="marked id-unique-15251">everyone</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-15120">working</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15139">together</span>.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was <span class="marked id-unique-15290">attending</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15403">Calgary</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15154">Stampede</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15395">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15275">concern</span>
on <span class="marked id-unique-15311">Twitter</span>.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those <span class="marked id-unique-15330">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he <span class="marked id-unique-15132">tweeted</span>. “<span class="marked id-unique-15333">Horrible</span> news.” In
a statement <span class="marked id-unique-15217">later</span>, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can <span class="marked id-unique-15421">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15419">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-15361">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-15370">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15407">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-15390">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-15380">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15367">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-15362">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15373">ready</span> to provide any assistance <span class="marked id-unique-15422">requested</span> by
the province.” <span class="marked id-unique-15208">Meanwhile</span>, some <span class="marked id-unique-15270">counted</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-15284">blessings</span>
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-15338">Friday</span> night.  <span class="marked id-unique-15238">Frederique</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15210">Mailloux</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-15147">supposed</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15206">meet</span> up with <span class="marked id-unique-15366">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local <span class="marked id-unique-15158">singer</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-15222">Instead</span>,
it was one of the <span class="marked id-unique-15179">rare</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15194">occasions</span> she <span class="marked id-unique-15265">decided</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15157">skip</span> a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-15397">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are <span class="marked id-unique-15175">relieved</span>.” With <span class="marked id-unique-15243">files</span> from Canadian Press

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-15340">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been <span class="marked id-unique-15264">declared</span> dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-15414">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-15388">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15415">speed</span>
in the <span class="marked id-unique-15334">heart</span> of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-15230">heard</span> the
now <span class="marked id-unique-15232">haunting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15178">rattle</span> of an <span class="marked id-unique-15293">approaching</span> train. Then he felt
the <span class="marked id-unique-15336">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15162">shake</span>.  But it <span class="marked id-unique-15126">wasn't</span> until the driverless
freight train, <span class="marked id-unique-15219">laden</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-15414">tankers</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15128">volatile</span> crude oil,
<span class="marked id-unique-15331">hurtled</span> off the track that he <span class="marked id-unique-15223">instantly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15190">perceived</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-15267">danger</span> he was in.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-15369">saw</span> and felt the <span class="marked id-unique-15254">enormous</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15351">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-15420">rolling</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15137">towards</span> the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-15320">picturesque</span> lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were <span class="marked id-unique-15255">enjoying</span> a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-15148">summer's</span> night on the patio.
"It was like an <span class="marked id-unique-15294">apocalyptic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15129">vision</span>," said Theberge, <span class="marked id-unique-15303">44</span>,
who <span class="marked id-unique-15149">suffered</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15404">burns</span> to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-15326">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that <span class="marked id-unique-15160">shot</span> flames <span class="marked id-unique-15387">hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15205">metres</span>
into the air and <span class="marked id-unique-15218">laid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15125">waste</span> to downtown Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-15226">However</span>, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was <span class="marked id-unique-15316">saying</span> authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-15314">shock</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15123">wave</span> from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, <span class="marked id-unique-15235">gutted</span> downtown businesses and left dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-15191">people
- possibly</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-15300">60 - unaccounted</span> for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of <span class="marked id-unique-15417">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-15387">Hundreds</span> of
people had to <span class="marked id-unique-15165">scramble</span> for safety, <span class="marked id-unique-15241">fleeing</span> the intense heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-15359">towering</span> flames <span class="marked id-unique-15213">lit</span> up the night sky.  Theberge,
who <span class="marked id-unique-15119">works</span> at the Musi-Cafe, said he <span class="marked id-unique-15220">knows</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15360">three</span> of the
missing people: <span class="marked id-unique-15245">fellow</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15342">employees</span> who haven't <span class="marked id-unique-15172">responded</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-15174">repeated</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15144">telephone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15280">calls</span>. While he and his <span class="marked id-unique-15192">pals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15252">escaped</span>,
those inside the restaurant may have been <span class="marked id-unique-15135">trapped</span> in an
<span class="marked id-unique-15386">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, <span class="marked id-unique-15349">beside</span> the railway tracks that
<span class="marked id-unique-15322">pass</span> right through the <span class="marked id-unique-15334">heart</span> of downtown, is <span class="marked id-unique-15256">emerging</span> in
<span class="marked id-unique-15394">eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15352">accounts</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-15336">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15117">zero</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-15266">deadly</span> explosion.
<span class="marked id-unique-15118">Yannick</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15337">Gagne</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15323">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-15310">unable</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15271">contact</span> some <span class="marked id-unique-15342">employees</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-15337">Gagne</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-15180">radio</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15153">station</span> he left the restaurant about <span class="marked id-unique-15354">20</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15204">minutes</span> before the
first explosion and he could <span class="marked id-unique-15246">feel</span> the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-15384">kilometre</span> away at his home.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-15229">hopped</span> on his <span class="marked id-unique-15285">bicycle</span>
and got to what he <span class="marked id-unique-15140">thought</span> was a <span class="marked id-unique-15168">safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15343">distance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15289">away -
until</span> the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., <span class="marked id-unique-15166">scorched</span> his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-15324">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
help those who <span class="marked id-unique-15234">hadn't</span> fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-15399">crowded</span> when the train <span class="marked id-unique-15240">flew</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-15319">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-15329">initial</span> blast was so intense that <span class="marked id-unique-15170">Roger</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15406">Beauchesne</span>,
who was outside his <span class="marked id-unique-15228">house</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15412">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take <span class="marked id-unique-15269">cover</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15350">behind</span> his car to <span class="marked id-unique-15182">protect</span> himself
from the heat.  <span class="marked id-unique-15406">Beauchesne</span> said the <span class="marked id-unique-15197">municipal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15214">library</span>,
which is <span class="marked id-unique-15349">beside</span> the railway tracks, was <span class="marked id-unique-15296">among</span> the buildings
<span class="marked id-unique-15263">demolished</span> by the blasts, <span class="marked id-unique-15297">along</span> with Dollarama and the
Metro <span class="marked id-unique-15236">grocery</span>. Late Saturday firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-15291">assisted</span> by
<span class="marked id-unique-15156">specialists</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15131">Ultramar</span> were still <span class="marked id-unique-15288">battling</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15188">persistent</span>
fires, burning <span class="marked id-unique-15261">despite</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-15151">steady</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15257">drizzle</span>.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15402">cause</span> of the accident is itself <span class="marked id-unique-15133">turning</span> out to be
<span class="marked id-unique-15150">stranger</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-15244">fiction</span>. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-15423">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15377">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
<span class="marked id-unique-15250">executive</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15409">World</span>, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-15411">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-15416">Somehow</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-15231">headed</span> into town <span class="marked id-unique-15410">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-15396">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-15391">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-15372">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-15408">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think we've <span class="marked id-unique-15405">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on <span class="marked id-unique-15248">fatal</span> train derailment

The <span class="marked id-unique-15305">10-year-old</span> railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-15418">serving</span> Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-15385">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-15309">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-15393">Gazette</span> the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-15313">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-15381">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15328">locked</span> the brakes, <span class="marked id-unique-15253">ensuring</span>
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-15315">secured</span>. He then <span class="marked id-unique-15345">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-15332">hotel</span> for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-15364">Sometime</span> after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It <span class="marked id-unique-15134">travelled</span> under
its own <span class="marked id-unique-15225">inertia</span> to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-15368">security</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15207">mechanisms</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15184">prevent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15146">tampering</span> with
the train, and the conductor had <span class="marked id-unique-15259">done</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15183">proper</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15277">checks</span>
before <span class="marked id-unique-15216">leaving</span> the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in <span class="marked id-unique-15199">motion</span>.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-15312">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-15347">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-15306">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-15317">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-15416">somehow</span>,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-15318">released</span>," McGonigle told <span class="marked id-unique-15171">Reuters</span>.
"<span class="marked id-unique-15142">That's</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-15273">confuses</span> us. How did this <span class="marked id-unique-15233">happen</span>? There are
many <span class="marked id-unique-15249">fail-safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15203">modes</span>. How this happened is just <span class="marked id-unique-15286">beyond</span>
us." The <span class="marked id-unique-15136">Transportation</span> Safety <span class="marked id-unique-15348">Board</span> of Canada is <span class="marked id-unique-15327">looking</span>
for the black <span class="marked id-unique-15283">box</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15274">confirm</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15260">direction</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15415">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are <span class="marked id-unique-15272">considering</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-15185">possible</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15268">criminal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15221">investigation</span>.  Lt. Lapointe said
<span class="marked id-unique-15193">officers</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-15276">collecting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15394">eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15352">accounts</span> as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-15321">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15307">videos</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15279">cellphones</span>.  They are also <span class="marked id-unique-15327">looking</span>
into a <span class="marked id-unique-15371">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-15379">Nantes</span> fire <span class="marked id-unique-15398">department</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-15161">short</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15258">drive</span> from town, confirmed last night that it had <span class="marked id-unique-15176">received</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-15281">call</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15364">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-15381">midnight</span> about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just <span class="marked id-unique-15316">saying</span> it's one of the <span class="marked id-unique-15186">possibilities</span>," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to <span class="marked id-unique-15242">fill</span>
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and <span class="marked id-unique-15211">lots</span> of firefighters. This is so <span class="marked id-unique-15169">saddening</span>
to see," said <span class="marked id-unique-15215">Leonard</span> Bedard, <span class="marked id-unique-15299">80</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-15383">lives</span> about a
<span class="marked id-unique-15384">kilometre</span> away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-15378">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15298">allow</span> trains carrying
that <span class="marked id-unique-15198">much</span> oil to <span class="marked id-unique-15322">pass</span> through towns. It <span class="marked id-unique-15325">makes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15353">absolutely</span>
no <span class="marked id-unique-15164">sense</span>, and it <span class="marked id-unique-15325">makes</span> me <span class="marked id-unique-15295">angry</span>."

Bedard said that is "<span class="marked id-unique-15200">mostly</span> businesses destroyed, but about
30 to <span class="marked id-unique-15304">40</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15227">houses</span> as well. I hope they <span class="marked id-unique-15177">rebuild</span>." <span class="marked id-unique-15356">Worried</span>
residents <span class="marked id-unique-15124">watched</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-15350">behind</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15189">perimeters</span> set up by
authorities, <span class="marked id-unique-15159">sick</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-15247">fear</span> that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on <span class="marked id-unique-15130">vacation</span>,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told <span class="marked id-unique-15173">reporters</span>. "We're
<span class="marked id-unique-15278">checking</span> all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-15346">can't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15143">tell</span> you at the <span class="marked id-unique-15202">moment</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15122">whether</span> there are any <span class="marked id-unique-15308">victims</span> or people who are <span class="marked id-unique-15224">injured</span>."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
<span class="marked id-unique-15341">evacuated</span> from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was <span class="marked id-unique-15282">bustling</span> as the train <span class="marked id-unique-15331">hurtled</span> in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15413">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-15375">population</span>."
Demers, who has <span class="marked id-unique-15212">lived</span> in Lac-Megantic for <span class="marked id-unique-15302">45</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15408">years</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-15262">describes</span> it as a "<span class="marked id-unique-15195">nice</span> town." "Everybody is very
<span class="marked id-unique-15237">friendly</span> ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-15365">small</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15358">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it <span class="marked id-unique-15121">won't</span> be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-15339">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15335">group</span>
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who <span class="marked id-unique-15401">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-15374">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15376">phone</span>.  About <span class="marked id-unique-15301">450</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-15341">evacuated</span> residents are <span class="marked id-unique-15152">staying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-15187">Polyvalente</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15201">Montignac</span>,
a local <span class="marked id-unique-15167">school</span>, where <span class="marked id-unique-15354">20</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15127">volunteers</span> from the Red <span class="marked id-unique-15400">Cross</span>
are <span class="marked id-unique-15389">helping</span> out.  "For now we're <span class="marked id-unique-15389">helping</span> them get
<span class="marked id-unique-15163">settled</span> in, <span class="marked id-unique-15181">providing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15239">food</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15287">beds</span>, as well as <span class="marked id-unique-15389">helping</span>
them <span class="marked id-unique-15392">getting</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-15138">touch</span> with loved ones," said Red <span class="marked id-unique-15400">Cross</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15363">spokeswoman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15196">Myriam</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15209">Marotte</span>. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-15344">continue</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15292">assist</span>
as <span class="marked id-unique-15382">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-15357">want</span> us to." <span class="marked id-unique-15406">Beauchesne</span> said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-15355">160</span> firefighters on the scene and <span class="marked id-unique-15141">there's</span>
a "<span class="marked id-unique-15145">team</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15155">spirit</span>" in the town and “<span class="marked id-unique-15251">everyone</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-15120">working</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15139">together</span>.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was <span class="marked id-unique-15290">attending</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15403">Calgary</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15154">Stampede</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15395">expressed</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15275">concern</span>
on <span class="marked id-unique-15311">Twitter</span>.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those <span class="marked id-unique-15330">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he <span class="marked id-unique-15132">tweeted</span>. “<span class="marked id-unique-15333">Horrible</span> news.” In
a statement <span class="marked id-unique-15217">later</span>, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can <span class="marked id-unique-15421">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15419">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-15361">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-15370">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15407">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-15390">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-15380">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15367">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-15362">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15373">ready</span> to provide any assistance <span class="marked id-unique-15422">requested</span> by
the province.” <span class="marked id-unique-15208">Meanwhile</span>, some <span class="marked id-unique-15270">counted</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-15284">blessings</span>
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-15338">Friday</span> night.  <span class="marked id-unique-15238">Frederique</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15210">Mailloux</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-15147">supposed</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15206">meet</span> up with <span class="marked id-unique-15366">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local <span class="marked id-unique-15158">singer</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-15222">Instead</span>,
it was one of the <span class="marked id-unique-15179">rare</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15194">occasions</span> she <span class="marked id-unique-15265">decided</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15157">skip</span> a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-15397">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-15526">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-15508">First</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15522">Bernard</span> Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-15534">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-15534">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-15488">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-15530">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-15448">burns</span> to his right <span class="marked id-unique-15536">arm</span>.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-15465">others</span> on the
patio <span class="marked id-unique-15533">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-15510">death</span> of one <span class="marked id-unique-15526">person</span> in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-15485">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-15511">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-15535">evening</span>, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15489">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-15520">expect</span> there
will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-15519">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15472">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-15498">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-15491">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-15500">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-15456">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-15532">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-15425">towering</span> flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-15516">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows <span class="marked id-unique-15426">three</span> of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-15508">first</span> explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-15518">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his <span class="marked id-unique-15536">arm</span>. He
said there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-15530">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-15533">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many <span class="marked id-unique-15517">popular</span> bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-15505">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-15532">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-15454">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-15494">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-15475">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-15504">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-15471">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-15467">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-15476">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15446">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-15461">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15436">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-15490">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15521">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15451">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-15464">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-15492">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-15453">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-15469">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-15524">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-15452">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-15482">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15525">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15523">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-15524">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-15521">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-15525">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15523">applied</span> on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-15512">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-15441">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-15433">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-15529">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-15512">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15449">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-15507">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-15528">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-15484">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-15457">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-15497">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15502">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-15513">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-15431">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-15499">everything</span> by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-15503">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-15486">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-15445">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-15479">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-15473">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-15516">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a <span class="marked id-unique-15531">lot</span> of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-15439">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-15514">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-15501">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15466">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15477">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-15522">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15509">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-15528">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-15518">home</span>.  "<span class="marked id-unique-15527">Early</span> this <span class="marked id-unique-15487">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-15480">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15478">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-15468">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-15483">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-15535">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-15531">lot</span> of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-15474">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15455">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-15435">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-15509">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-15529">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-15442">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-15429">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-15438">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-15424">want</span> us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-15515">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-15447">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-15443">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-15493">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-15496">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-15495">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-15506">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-15470">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-15459">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15458">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-15427">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-15432">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15450">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-15440">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-15437">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-15430">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-15428">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15434">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15463">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15481">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15460">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-15462">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-15517">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-15444">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-15473">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15476">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-15526">person</span>. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-15510">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-15532">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-15425">towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-15516">sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-15479">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-15438">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-15492">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-15488">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-15500">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15466">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15477">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-15526">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-15501">died</span>. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-15465">others</span>
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-15489">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-15444">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15424">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-15520">expect</span> we'll have other people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-15519">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15472">deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-15442">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-15454">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15426">three</span> times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-15517">popular</span> area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-15508">first</span> explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-15446">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-15461">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15436">operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-15451">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-15464">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-15453">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-15482">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15525">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15523">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-15524">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-15490">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15521">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-15525">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15523">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-15521">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-15469">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15524">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-15512">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-15441">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-15433">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-15529">years</span>,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-15512">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15449">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-15504">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-15530">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-15439">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-15527">early</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15487">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15516">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-15522">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the <span class="marked id-unique-15517">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-15508">first</span> explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-15486">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-15448">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-15536">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-15503">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-15491">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-15431">security</span> perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-15535">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-15531">lot</span> of people there," said <span class="marked id-unique-15522">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15509">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-15528">owns</span> a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-15505">blast</span> site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-15474">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-15455">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-15435">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-15509">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-15533">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-15518">home</span>, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-15480">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15478">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-15468">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-15483">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-15534">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-15518">home</span> after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-15498">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-15467">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-15471">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-15499">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-15494">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-15506">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-15511">air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-15456">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-15515">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-15443">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-15495">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-15493">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-15496">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-15485">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-15470">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-15459">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-15458">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-15427">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-15432">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15450">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-15440">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-15437">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-15430">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-15428">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-15434">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-15463">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-15481">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-15460">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-15462">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company <span class="marked id-unique-15528">owns</span> more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-15484">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-15457">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-15513">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-15497">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-15502">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-15447">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-15452">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-15507">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-15475">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-15445">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-15514">trains</span>
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-15429">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren said recently.

One <span class="marked id-unique-20037">dead</span>, many <span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span> as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-20037">dead</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-20016">driverless</span>
freight train <span class="marked id-unique-20022">carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20018">oil</span> tankers derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-20014">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-20016">driverless</span>
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude <span class="marked id-unique-20018">oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-19986">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-20000">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-20023">patio</span>.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-19988">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-20023">patio</span> fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-19976">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-19998">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-20039">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-20001">Guy</span> Lapointe of the <span class="marked id-unique-20041">Quebec</span>
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-20030">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-19994">destroyed</span> 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-20017">businesses</span> and left <span class="marked id-unique-20025">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-20010">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span> people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-20024">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-20048">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-19990">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-19982">crowded</span> when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-20040">blast</span> was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-20005">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-19993">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-19983">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
<span class="marked id-unique-20035">fires</span>, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-19987">railway's</span> operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-20020">runaway</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-20002">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-20042">parked</span>
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-20036">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-20015">Somehow</span> it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-19984">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-19981">driver</span>.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-20033">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-20033">brakes</span>
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-20034">zone</span>: <span class="marked id-unique-20041">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20021">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-19985">serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20041">Quebec</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20009">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20012">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-20043">Vermont</span>.
Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-20019">McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the <span class="marked id-unique-20033">brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-19977">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said <span class="marked id-unique-20019">McGonigle</span>. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-19979">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-20029">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-20036">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-20042">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-20015">somehow</span>,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-20019">McGonigle</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> Reuters.
"That's what confuses <span class="marked id-unique-19995">us</span>. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-20029">happened</span> is just beyond
<span class="marked id-unique-19995">us</span>." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-20011">Canada</span> is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-20026">black</span> box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-20014">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-20031">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-19999">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a <span class="marked id-unique-19989">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke <span class="marked id-unique-19991">continued</span> to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-20026">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-19983">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-20044">trains</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20022">carrying</span>
that much <span class="marked id-unique-20018">oil</span> to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-20017">businesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19994">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-19979">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-20049">friends</span>
and loved ones may have died.  "We're <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> some people are
<span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-20048">home</span>.  "<span class="marked id-unique-20032">Early</span> this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-19992">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small <span class="marked id-unique-19997">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-19979">set</span> up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-19980">reached</span> by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a <span class="marked id-unique-19996">local</span> school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them <span class="marked id-unique-20027">get</span>
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-19978">continue</span> to assist
as long as the authorities want <span class="marked id-unique-19995">us</span> to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-19983">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-20046">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20047">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20045">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-20004">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-20008">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-20006">statement</span> later, the <span class="marked id-unique-20046">prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20047">minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20013">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six <span class="marked id-unique-20049">friends</span> at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular <span class="marked id-unique-19996">local</span> singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-20024">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-20038">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20007">Press</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-20011">Canada</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-20040">blast</span>: Lac-Megantic death toll <span class="marked id-unique-19979">set</span> to rise

Deaths feared in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-19992">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
<span class="marked id-unique-19995">US</span> train derailment Bridge collapses after <span class="marked id-unique-19995">US</span> rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-20037">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-20020">runaway</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-20022">carrying</span> light crude <span class="marked id-unique-20018">oil</span> exploded
in the <span class="marked id-unique-20038">Canadian</span> town of Lac-Megantic.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20040">blast</span> sent a <span class="marked id-unique-20030">fireball</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20026">black</span> smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-20039">air</span>,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-20025">Dozens</span> of buildings were <span class="marked id-unique-19994">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-20010">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for <span class="marked id-unique-20025">dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span> people.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20044">train's</span> cars reportedly uncoupled from a <span class="marked id-unique-20042">parked</span> engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-20032">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-20021">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-19997">village</span> before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-19999">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19986">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-20016">driverless</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-19980">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-20014">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
<span class="marked id-unique-19978">continue</span> at dawn.

<span class="marked id-unique-19996">Local</span> media have reported up to 100 people <span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span>.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-19988">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-20001">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported <span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span>
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported <span class="marked id-unique-20028">missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 <span class="marked id-unique-19983">firefighters</span> have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-20031">blaze</span>, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-19991">continued</span> for more than 24 hours.

<span class="marked id-unique-19983">Firefighters</span> from across the border in the <span class="marked id-unique-19995">US</span> are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-19982">crowded</span> at the time of the
<span class="marked id-unique-20040">blast</span>, and that "chaos" ensued.


<span class="marked id-unique-19983">Firefighters</span> fought the <span class="marked id-unique-20031">blaze</span> for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-20023">patio</span> of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-19976">lucky</span> to escape and feared for
those <span class="marked id-unique-20024">inside</span> the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
<span class="marked id-unique-20007">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-19993">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-19984">without</span> stopping," she <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-19990">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19989">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude <span class="marked id-unique-20018">oil</span>, and
was <span class="marked id-unique-20042">parked</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19997">village</span> of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-19981">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-19987">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-20002">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-20036">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20042">parked</span> the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-20033">brakes</span> on
"properly" before going to a <span class="marked id-unique-19996">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19977">hotel</span> for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-20015">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe <span class="marked id-unique-20019">McGonigle</span>.


<span class="marked id-unique-20038">Canadian</span> PM <span class="marked id-unique-20045">Stephen</span> Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-20029">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-20033">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-20019">McGonigle</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-20030">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-20017">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-20034">zone</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19979">set</span> up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-19994">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-20027">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche <span class="marked id-unique-20003">told</span> a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-20046">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20047">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20045">Stephen</span> Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-20006">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-20004">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20008">prayers</span> go out to the families and <span class="marked id-unique-20049">friends</span> of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-19998">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20035">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-20041">Quebec</span>.

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-20044">train's</span> cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment <span class="marked id-unique-20041">Quebec</span> spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-20005">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-19979">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the <span class="marked id-unique-20039">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-20013">added</span>.

The train was <span class="marked id-unique-20022">carrying</span> the crude <span class="marked id-unique-20018">oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track <span class="marked id-unique-19985">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-20043">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-20041">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20009">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20012">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-20000">lakeside</span> town that is <span class="marked id-unique-20048">home</span> to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-19995">US</span> border with <span class="marked id-unique-20043">Vermont</span> and

One <span class="marked id-unique-20127">dead</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> missing as train explodes in <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span>
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-20127">dead</span> after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-20050">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-20068">high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-20114">LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20123">QUE</span>.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with <span class="marked id-unique-20050">tankers</span> of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-20075">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20103">afternoon</span> police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-20105">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span>.

However, by <span class="marked id-unique-20117">late</span> evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-20090">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20107">Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-20080">deceased</span>." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-20055">shock</span> wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-20108">30</span> buildings and
<span class="marked id-unique-20093">homes</span>, gutted <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20102">businesses</span> and left dozens of people
- possibly as <span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-20130">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the <span class="marked id-unique-20052">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20053">tracks</span> that
pass right through the heart of <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span>, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-20085">kilometre</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20115">away</span> at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-20101">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:<span class="marked id-unique-20108">30</span> a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-20062">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-20110">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-20074">two</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20051">kilometres</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span>,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-20095">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the <span class="marked id-unique-20052">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20053">tracks</span>, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-20119">blasts</span>, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-20117">Late</span> Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were <span class="marked id-unique-20094">still</span> battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-20081">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-20091">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20063">Burkhardt</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20097">chief</span>
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20072">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-20078">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic <span class="marked id-unique-20052">Railway</span>, said the <span class="marked id-unique-20092">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-20129">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20073">uphill</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-20126">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20079">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-20069">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-20121">brakes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20083">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20070">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20064">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-20120">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-20069">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20115">away</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-20063">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-20121">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-20070">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20064">applied</span> on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20104">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old <span class="marked id-unique-20052">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20071">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-20084">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20051">kilometres</span> of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-20096">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20099">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-20111">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a <span class="marked id-unique-20052">railway</span> vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the <span class="marked id-unique-20121">brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-20056">secured</span>. He then checked into a
<span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-20100">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-20118">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-20126">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-20129">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
<span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-20118">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-20098">Canada</span> is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-20107">Lapointe</span> said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-20057">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20054">videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had <span class="marked id-unique-20088">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-20067">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-20107">Lapointe</span>
said Saturday night.  Billowing <span class="marked id-unique-20061">smoke</span> continued to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-20130">sky</span> Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20103">afternoon</span>.  "We can <span class="marked id-unique-20094">still</span> see a lot of
black <span class="marked id-unique-20061">smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
<span class="marked id-unique-20085">kilometre</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20115">away</span>. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-20112">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-20102">businesses</span> destroyed, but about
<span class="marked id-unique-20108">30</span> to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-20071">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-20089">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20106">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-20060">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20058">group</span>
was <span class="marked id-unique-20125">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span> up to <span class="marked id-unique-20062">help</span> people track down loved ones
who <span class="marked id-unique-20087">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-20065">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20066">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-20109">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20086">Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-20109">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20086">Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-20113">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span>,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-20093">homes</span> safely and <span class="marked id-unique-20125">quickly</span>. The
people of <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-20077">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-20082">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20076">requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20059">Friday</span> night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't <span class="marked id-unique-20061">smoke</span>, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-20128">Press</span>

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet <span class="marked id-unique-20123">Que</span>. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> are in <span class="marked id-unique-20055">shock</span> following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-20113">Stephen</span> Harper is <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span> to visit <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-20123">Que</span>., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span> off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span>
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-20125">quickly</span> spread to <span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20093">homes</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-20102">businesses</span> Saturday.  The <span class="marked id-unique-20119">blasts</span> destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-20108">30</span>
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the <span class="marked id-unique-20130">sky</span>.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train
carrying crude oil is <span class="marked id-unique-20094">still</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20081">burning</span> in the eastern Quebec

<span class="marked id-unique-20061">Smoke</span> rises from <span class="marked id-unique-20052">railway</span> cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span> Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-20098">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-20128">Press</span>, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-20105">death</span> toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-20080">deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-20090">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20107">Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-20127">dead</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-20107">Lapointe</span> would not
give an estimate to how <span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews <span class="marked id-unique-20087">couldn't</span> reach a section
of the town due to fears that <span class="marked id-unique-20101">five</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-20050">tankers</span> cars
might <span class="marked id-unique-20094">still</span> explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and <span class="marked id-unique-20116">many</span> were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-20101">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20050">tankers</span> with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-20082">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-20076">requested</span> any
<span class="marked id-unique-20062">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> fire <span class="marked id-unique-20097">chief</span> Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-20118">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-20077">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
<span class="marked id-unique-20052">Railway</span> Inc., which <span class="marked id-unique-20071">owns</span> the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-20100">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:<span class="marked id-unique-20108">30</span> a.m.
President and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20072">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-20078">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic <span class="marked id-unique-20052">Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20091">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20063">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-20129">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20073">uphill</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-20063">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-20128">Press</span> that he
doesn't understand how the train got <span class="marked id-unique-20115">away</span>.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-20121">brakes</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20083">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20070">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20064">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-20120">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-20069">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20115">away</span>," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-20121">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-20070">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20064">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-20129">parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-20126">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20079">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-20069">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-20092">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-20129">parked</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20056">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-20067">Nantes</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-20123">Que</span>., just west of <span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20117">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20059">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-20074">two</span>
town centres are about 12 <span class="marked id-unique-20051">kilometres</span> apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-20100">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-20089">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-20088">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20075">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-20053">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-20112">train's</span> engine was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-20085">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the <span class="marked id-unique-20052">railway</span> serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-20111">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-20096">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20099">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20071">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-20084">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20051">kilometres</span>
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-20053">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-20110">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-20068">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-20057">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20054">videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of <span class="marked id-unique-20061">smoke</span> emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-20104">officials</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-20119">blasts</span> took
place near the <span class="marked id-unique-20122">downtown</span> core - a popular <span class="marked id-unique-20106">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their <span class="marked id-unique-20093">homes</span>, and a number of
people are <span class="marked id-unique-20094">still</span> accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-20060">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20058">group</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span> up to <span class="marked id-unique-20062">help</span> track down
residents who <span class="marked id-unique-20087">couldn't</span> immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-20065">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20066">phone</span>.
The <span class="marked id-unique-20109">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20086">Cross</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20124">set</span> up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20103">afternoon</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-20095">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
<span class="marked id-unique-20114">Lac-Megantic</span> Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

One dead, <span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20176">missing</span> as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-20173">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span> at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-20134">First</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20142">Bernard</span> Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-20245">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-20245">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-20215">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-20241">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-20258">patio</span>.
"It was <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> an apocalyptic vision," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-20168">burns</span> to his right <span class="marked id-unique-20247">arm</span>.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-20191">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-20258">patio</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20244">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-20251">death</span> of one <span class="marked id-unique-20173">person</span> in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-20212">subsequent</span> explosions that shot <span class="marked id-unique-20248">flames</span> hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-20252">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-20246">evening</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20224">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20216">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20254">Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-20223">provincial</span> police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-20198">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-20231">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20211">destroyed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20255">30</span> buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-20218">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as <span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-20233">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20182">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for <span class="marked id-unique-20220">safety</span>, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-20243">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-20145">towering</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20248">flames</span> lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-20138">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> he knows <span class="marked id-unique-20146">three</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-20176">missing</span> people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-20260">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span>.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-20134">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the <span class="marked id-unique-20248">flames</span> a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-20140">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span>, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:<span class="marked id-unique-20255">30</span> a.m., scorched his <span class="marked id-unique-20247">arm</span>. He
<span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-20241">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-20244">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>
the town centre, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20139">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20266">bars</span>, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-20238">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-20243">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was <span class="marked id-unique-20259">outside</span> his house <span class="marked id-unique-20180">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
<span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> he had to <span class="marked id-unique-20226">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-20201">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-20237">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-20197">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-20193">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20174">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-20202">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20166">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-20187">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20156">operator</span>,
the <span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span> train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-20217">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20141">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20177">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-20190">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20219">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-20221">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20179">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-20195">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-20171">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-20178">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-20208">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20172">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20143">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-20171">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20141">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-20222">think</span> the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-20172">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20143">applied</span> on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-20137">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-20161">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20220">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20153">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20240">years</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>. "Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-20222">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20137">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20169">blown</span> it here."

<span class="marked id-unique-20132">Like</span> a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20250">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-20175">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-20210">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-20183">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-20230">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20235">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train <span class="marked id-unique-20259">outside</span>
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>
there are <span class="marked id-unique-20151">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-20232">everything</span> by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-20221">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
<span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation <span class="marked id-unique-20220">Safety</span> Board of Canada is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-20263">black</span> box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-20223">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  <span class="marked id-unique-20224">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20254">Lapointe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-20236">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20213">started</span> before the train
<span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-20165">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-20254">Lapointe</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-20205">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-20199">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-20138">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We <span class="marked id-unique-20249">can</span> still see a <span class="marked id-unique-20242">lot</span> of
<span class="marked id-unique-20263">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-20174">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> Leonard <span class="marked id-unique-20265">Bedard</span>, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-20159">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through <span class="marked id-unique-20256">towns</span>. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

<span class="marked id-unique-20265">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> that is "mostly businesses <span class="marked id-unique-20211">destroyed</span>, but about
<span class="marked id-unique-20255">30</span> to 40 houses as well. I <span class="marked id-unique-20261">hope</span> they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-20234">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
<span class="marked id-unique-20176">missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-20223">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-20224">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20192">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20203">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-20142">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20135">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-20175">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-20140">home</span>.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-20214">morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-20264">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-20206">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20204">bomb</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-20194">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-20262">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20209">afraid</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-20246">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-20242">lot</span> of people there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-20264">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span>. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-20200">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-20181">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-20155">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-20135">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-20240">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "<span class="marked id-unique-20262">Everybody</span> is very
friendly ... It's <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-20257">Red</span> Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-20162">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20257">Red</span> Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-20149">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-20158">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-20144">want</span> us to." Beauchesne <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-20174">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-20167">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-20163">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-20225">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-20229">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-20227">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-20239">added</span>: “We <span class="marked id-unique-20261">hope</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20196">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20249">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20185">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-20184">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-20147">surrounding</span> areas <span class="marked id-unique-20249">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20152">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20170">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-20160">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-20157">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20150">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-20148">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20154">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-20189">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-20207">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20186">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-20188">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-20139">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-20164">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-20260">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>. “When you <span class="marked id-unique-20222">think</span> of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-20228">Press</span>

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-20199">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20202">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span> in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-20211">destroyed</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-20256">town's</span> center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-20173">person</span>. Police <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-20251">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-20243">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-20145">towering</span>
fireballs and a <span class="marked id-unique-20257">red</span> glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-20138">sky</span>,
witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20248">Flames</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20205">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20263">black</span> smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-20158">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-20219">73-car</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-20215">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-20233">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20223">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-20224">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20192">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20203">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-20173">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20234">died</span>. He refused to say how <span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20191">others</span>
might be dead, but <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span>"
people have been reported <span class="marked id-unique-20176">missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20224">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20216">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20254">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20223">provincial</span>
police, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>: "I <span class="marked id-unique-20164">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20144">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-20198">deceased</span> unfortunately."

<span class="marked id-unique-20254">Lapointe</span> refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-20162">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-20176">missing</span>, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-20180">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20146">three</span> times <span class="marked id-unique-20176">missing</span> by different
members of the family," he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-20139">popular</span> area packed with <span class="marked id-unique-20266">bars</span> that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20134">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-20211">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20166">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-20187">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20156">operator</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20177">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-20190">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the
train had been <span class="marked id-unique-20221">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20179">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-20208">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20172">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20143">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-20171">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20217">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20141">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-20222">think</span> the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-20172">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20143">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-20141">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the
train was <span class="marked id-unique-20221">parked</span> because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-20195">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-20171">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-20137">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-20161">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20220">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20153">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20240">years</span>,"
he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-20222">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20137">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20169">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-20237">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-20255">30</span>
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span>
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-20241">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-20159">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-20214">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20138">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20142">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-20259">outside</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-20266">bar's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20258">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the <span class="marked id-unique-20220">safety</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-20260">inside</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-20139">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-20134">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-20213">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> a movie," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-20168">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-20247">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

<span class="marked id-unique-20174">Firefighters</span>, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-20236">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-20218">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-20151">security</span> perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-20136">many</span> feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-20256">town's</span> main
street, <span class="marked id-unique-20248">flames</span> danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-20246">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-20242">lot</span> of people there," <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20142">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20135">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-20175">owns</span> a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-20238">blast</span> site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-20264">big</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-20200">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-20181">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-20155">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-20135">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-20244">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-20140">home</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> was "<span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-20206">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20204">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-20194">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-20262">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20209">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-20245">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-20140">home</span> after an <span class="marked id-unique-20131">explosion</span> went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came <span class="marked id-unique-20132">like</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-20231">fireball</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>.

Another resident Claude <span class="marked id-unique-20265">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-20193">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-20197">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20232">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-20226">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-20239">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-20252">air</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20174">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-20182">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

<span class="marked id-unique-20174">Firefighters</span> from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-20163">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-20227">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-20225">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20229">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-20212">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span>.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-20261">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20196">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20249">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20185">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-20184">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-20147">surrounding</span> areas
<span class="marked id-unique-20249">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20152">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20170">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-20160">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-20157">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-20150">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-20148">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20154">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-20189">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-20207">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20186">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-20188">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company <span class="marked id-unique-20175">owns</span> more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-20210">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-20183">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-20230">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20235">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products <span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span>
in <span class="marked id-unique-20167">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The <span class="marked id-unique-20253">derailed</span> rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-20178">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-20250">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-20201">car</span> holds some <span class="marked id-unique-20255">30</span>,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-20165">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-20149">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren <span class="marked id-unique-20133">said</span> recently.

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-20269">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-20279">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-20299">freight</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-20304">carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20301">oil</span> tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-20299">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude <span class="marked id-unique-20301">oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
<span class="marked id-unique-20271">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-20282">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20300">afternoon</span> police
<span class="marked id-unique-20273">confirmed</span> the death of one <span class="marked id-unique-20279">person</span> in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying <span class="marked id-unique-20303">authorities</span> "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-20298">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-20295">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-20278">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-20298">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-20307">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was <span class="marked id-unique-20305">outside</span> his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the <span class="marked id-unique-20310">accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-20311">Montreal</span>,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-20291">73-car</span> train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-20314">zone</span>: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-20277">Joseph</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20302">McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
<span class="marked id-unique-20311">Montreal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20289">Gazette</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20280">conductor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20267">stopped</span> the train <span class="marked id-unique-20305">outside</span>
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-20288">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20268">locked</span> the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then <span class="marked id-unique-20270">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-20286">Sometime</span> after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-20284">loose</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-20302">McGonigle</span>. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the <span class="marked id-unique-20280">conductor</span> had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The <span class="marked id-unique-20280">conductor</span>,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-20312">happened</span>, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-20302">McGonigle</span> told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-20312">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-20275">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-20276">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, <span class="marked id-unique-20273">confirmed</span> last night that it had received
a call <span class="marked id-unique-20286">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-20288">midnight</span> about a <span class="marked id-unique-20297">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20300">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-20308">trains</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20304">carrying</span>
that much <span class="marked id-unique-20301">oil</span> to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I <span class="marked id-unique-20306">hope</span> they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
<span class="marked id-unique-20303">authorities</span>, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-20313">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-20290">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-20287">small</span> village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the <span class="marked id-unique-20303">authorities</span> want us to." Beauchesne said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-20272">160</span> firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-20309">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-20292">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-20294">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-20293">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-20296">added</span>: “We <span class="marked id-unique-20306">hope</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20285">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-20283">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-20281">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-20274">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

<span class="marked id-unique-20278">Inferno</span> In Quebec Town When Train <span class="marked id-unique-20269">Explodes</span>

At least one <span class="marked id-unique-20279">person</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-20313">died</span>, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-20299">freight</span> train pulling tank cars full of crude <span class="marked id-unique-20301">oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a <span class="marked id-unique-20287">small</span> Quebec town about <span class="marked id-unique-20272">160</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-20295">east</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-20311">Montreal</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20303">Authorities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20273">confirmed</span> the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war <span class="marked id-unique-20314">zone</span>.' " In a news
briefing, <span class="marked id-unique-20303">authorities</span> did not <span class="marked id-unique-20275">report</span> other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The <span class="marked id-unique-20311">Montreal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20289">Gazette</span>:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20290">morning</span> was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge <span class="marked id-unique-20271">ball</span> of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the <span class="marked id-unique-20297">locomotive</span>.
"<span class="marked id-unique-20277">Joseph</span> R. <span class="marked id-unique-20302">McGonigle</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20273">confirmed</span> to The <span class="marked id-unique-20289">Gazette</span> early
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20300">afternoon</span> that shortly before <span class="marked id-unique-20288">midnight</span>, the
<span class="marked id-unique-20308">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20280">conductor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20267">stopped</span> in nearby <span class="marked id-unique-20276">Nantes</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20268">locked</span> the
brakes and <span class="marked id-unique-20270">checked</span> to ensure that the rail cars <span class="marked id-unique-20304">carrying</span>
thousands of liters of crude <span class="marked id-unique-20301">oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " '<span class="marked id-unique-20286">Sometime</span> after (the first <span class="marked id-unique-20280">conductor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20298">left</span>),
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-20284">loose</span>,' said <span class="marked id-unique-20302">McGonigle</span>. ... The <span class="marked id-unique-20297">locomotive</span>
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-20291">73-car</span> train actually detached half a
mile <span class="marked id-unique-20305">outside</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-20287">small</span> town, he <span class="marked id-unique-20296">added</span>, but the cars
<span class="marked id-unique-20304">carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20301">oil</span> kept right on <span class="marked id-unique-20282">rolling</span>."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-20307">witnesses</span> reported between four and <span class="marked id-unique-20274">six</span> explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-20312">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Police say one <span class="marked id-unique-20279">person</span> has <span class="marked id-unique-20313">died</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-20310">accident</span>, CBC News

One dead, many missing as train explodes in <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-20392">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20391">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-20347">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20388">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-20337">LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
<span class="marked id-unique-20363">now</span> haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-20392">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20391">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-20365">saw</span> and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-20324">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20370">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-20335">right</span> arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the <span class="marked id-unique-20372">derailment</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-20369">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames <span class="marked id-unique-20367">hundreds</span> of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>.

However, by <span class="marked id-unique-20408">late</span> evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-20380">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-20362">destroyed</span> 30 <span class="marked id-unique-20341">buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-20390">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-20381">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20351">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-20367">Hundreds</span> of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who <span class="marked id-unique-20398">haven't</span> responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-20396">may</span> have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-20346">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-20399">tracks</span> that
pass <span class="marked id-unique-20335">right</span> through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
<span class="marked id-unique-20368">eyewitness</span> accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, <span class="marked id-unique-20325">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-20318">unable</span> to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-20390">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and <span class="marked id-unique-20371">got</span> to what he thought was a safe <span class="marked id-unique-20330">distance</span> away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-20372">derailment</span> and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-20326">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-20339">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-20403">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-20349">crowded</span> when the train flew off the <span class="marked id-unique-20323">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-20327">initial</span> blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-20375">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-20399">tracks</span>, was among the <span class="marked id-unique-20341">buildings</span>
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-20385">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-20356">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-20354">Metro</span> grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-20408">Late</span> Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-20393">runaway</span>.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-20407">Montreal</span>,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-20373">parked</span>
uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-20389">Somehow</span> it headed into town without a <span class="marked id-unique-20348">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-20338">We've</span> had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-20338">we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train <span class="marked id-unique-20372">derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-20378">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20383">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-20345">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-20317">vice-president</span>, told the
<span class="marked id-unique-20407">Montreal</span> Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
<span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train <span class="marked id-unique-20371">got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-20320">sure</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-20409">happened</span>, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-20332">book</span>. He had <span class="marked id-unique-20373">parked</span>
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-20315">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-20321">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-20389">somehow</span>,
the train <span class="marked id-unique-20371">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20322">released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-20409">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety <span class="marked id-unique-20333">Board</span> of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-20388">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting <span class="marked id-unique-20368">eyewitness</span> accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-20343">report</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-20384">blaze</span> had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-20379">last</span> night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-20359">Billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20336">smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black <span class="marked id-unique-20336">smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard <span class="marked id-unique-20402">Bedard</span>, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-20366">never</span> allow <span class="marked id-unique-20404">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes <span class="marked id-unique-20334">absolutely</span>
no sense, and it makes me angry."

<span class="marked id-unique-20402">Bedard</span> said that is "mostly businesses <span class="marked id-unique-20362">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-20364">Worried</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20387">residents</span> watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-20340">friends</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-20397">loved</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-20396">may</span> have <span class="marked id-unique-20382">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they <span class="marked id-unique-20396">may</span> just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-20353">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20357">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-20331">can't</span> tell you at the moment
whether there are any <span class="marked id-unique-20316">victims</span> or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-20401">big</span> explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-20360">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20358">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-20355">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-20400">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20361">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-20395">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-20406">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-20401">big</span> explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-20350">terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "<span class="marked id-unique-20400">Everybody</span> is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But <span class="marked id-unique-20363">now</span> it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-20339">help</span> people track down <span class="marked id-unique-20397">loved</span> ones
who couldn't be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-20344">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated <span class="marked id-unique-20387">residents</span> are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For <span class="marked id-unique-20363">now</span> we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with <span class="marked id-unique-20397">loved</span> ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-20405">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on <span class="marked id-unique-20319">Twitter</span>.  “<span class="marked id-unique-20374">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-20377">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-20328">impacted</span>
in <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-20329">Horrible</span> news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-20376">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-20386">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the <span class="marked id-unique-20352">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-20342">six</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20340">friends</span> at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't <span class="marked id-unique-20336">smoke</span>, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-20394">Canadian</span> Press

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-20324">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20394">Canadian</span> town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-20392">driverless</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20391">freight</span> train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-20367">hundreds</span> of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-20347">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20388">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-20393">runaway</span> train with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>
in Quebec before coming off the <span class="marked id-unique-20323">rails</span> shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-20369">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-20380">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-20359">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20336">smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-20403">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-20349">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-20370">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-20381">east</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-20407">Montreal</span>.

About 30 <span class="marked id-unique-20341">buildings</span> in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-20362">destroyed</span> in
the <span class="marked id-unique-20346">inferno</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20387">Residents</span> reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-20342">six</span>
loud <span class="marked id-unique-20385">blasts</span> soon after the <span class="marked id-unique-20372">derailment</span>.

Huge clouds of thick acrid <span class="marked id-unique-20336">smoke</span> could be seen still
rising from the centre of <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the <span class="marked id-unique-20372">derailment</span>.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-20384">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-20364">Worried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20387">residents</span> looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-20340">friends</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-20397">loved</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-20396">may</span> have <span class="marked id-unique-20382">died</span> in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-20318">unable</span>
to reach family or <span class="marked id-unique-20340">friends</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20344">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-20408">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20379">last</span> night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are <span class="marked id-unique-20364">worried</span>
because they <span class="marked id-unique-20398">haven't</span> been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-20331">can't</span> give out any information on what's happening
<span class="marked id-unique-20335">right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20363">now</span> because the firemen <span class="marked id-unique-20398">haven't</span> been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-20386">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
<span class="marked id-unique-20362">destroyed</span>, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-20353">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20357">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-20334">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20326">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-20316">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-20338">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-20405">Stephen</span> Harper took to <span class="marked id-unique-20319">Twitter</span> to release
an <span class="marked id-unique-20327">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20376">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-20374">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-20377">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-20328">impacted</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20329">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-20407">Montreal</span>, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-20378">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20383">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-20317">vice-president</span> of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-20345">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on <span class="marked id-unique-20333">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been <span class="marked id-unique-20373">parked</span> some <span class="marked id-unique-20330">distance</span> from the
town during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-20348">driver</span> shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-20320">sure</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-20409">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-20332">book</span>," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-20373">parked</span> the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-20315">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-20321">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20389">Somehow</span> the train <span class="marked id-unique-20371">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20322">released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to <span class="marked id-unique-20341">buildings</span> but
we <span class="marked id-unique-20398">haven't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20371">got</span> a full <span class="marked id-unique-20343">report</span> yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-20368">Eyewitness</span> Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-20390">left</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-20406">bar</span> when he <span class="marked id-unique-20365">saw</span> the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-20366">never</span> seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span>," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-20365">saw</span> the wagons come off the <span class="marked id-unique-20399">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

<span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> resident Claude <span class="marked id-unique-20402">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-20350">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-20338">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20366">never</span> seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-20354">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-20356">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-20325">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the <span class="marked id-unique-20372">derailment</span>, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-20360">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20358">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-20355">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20400">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20361">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-20404">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of <span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-20335">Right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20363">now</span> there is <span class="marked id-unique-20401">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20336">smoke</span> in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-20375">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-20351">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-20339">help</span> deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-20339">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

<span class="marked id-unique-20337">Lac-Megantic</span> is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an <span class="marked id-unique-20395">area</span> popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-20352">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

the <span class="marked id-unique-20663">town</span> centre, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-20729">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20737">popular</span> bars, was

who was <span class="marked id-unique-20667">outside</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-20558">house</span> two <span class="marked id-unique-20644">kilometres</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-20430">downtown</span>,

which is <span class="marked id-unique-20426">beside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20661">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20664">tracks</span>, was <span class="marked id-unique-20627">among</span> the buildings
<span class="marked id-unique-20594">demolished</span> by the blasts, <span class="marked id-unique-20628">along</span> with Dollarama and the

fires, burning <span class="marked id-unique-20592">despite</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-20480">steady</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20588">drizzle</span>.

The cause of the accident is itself <span class="marked id-unique-20462">turning</span> out to be
<span class="marked id-unique-20479">stranger</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-20575">fiction</span>. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span> was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
<span class="marked id-unique-20581">executive</span> of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic <span class="marked id-unique-20661">Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20722">said</span> the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span> was parked
uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-20732">Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-20726">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-20640">Somehow</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-20561">headed</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-20663">town</span> without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-20731">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span>, it's going
to run <span class="marked id-unique-20721">away</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-20722">said</span> Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-20655">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20731">brakes</span>
were properly applied on this <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span>." "<span class="marked id-unique-20733">We've</span> had a very
good <span class="marked id-unique-20497">safety</span> record for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20637">years</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20722">said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-20445">Well</span>,
I <span class="marked id-unique-20655">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20733">we've</span> blown it here."

that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-20694">secured</span>. He then <span class="marked id-unique-20714">checked</span> into a

before <span class="marked id-unique-20546">leaving</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-20431">night</span>. The <span class="marked id-unique-20434">conductor</span>,

<span class="marked id-unique-20594">demolished</span> by the blasts, <span class="marked id-unique-20628">along</span> with Dollarama and the

The cause of the accident is itself <span class="marked id-unique-20462">turning</span> out to be
<span class="marked id-unique-20479">stranger</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-20575">fiction</span>. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span> was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief

Maine & Atlantic <span class="marked id-unique-20661">Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20722">said</span> the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span> was parked
uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-20732">Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-20726">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-20640">Somehow</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-20561">headed</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-20663">town</span> without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-20731">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span>, it's going
to run <span class="marked id-unique-20721">away</span>," <span class="marked id-unique-20722">said</span> Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-20655">think</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20731">brakes</span>
were properly applied on this <span class="marked id-unique-20678">train</span>." "<span class="marked id-unique-20733">We've</span> had a very
good <span class="marked id-unique-20497">safety</span> record for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20637">years</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20722">said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-20445">Well</span>,
I <span class="marked id-unique-20655">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20733">we've</span> blown it here."

on <span class="marked id-unique-20690">Twitter</span>.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those <span class="marked id-unique-20705">impacted</span>

a statement <span class="marked id-unique-20547">later</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-20736">prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20738">minister</span> added: “We <span class="marked id-unique-20669">hope</span>

that they were not <span class="marked id-unique-20430">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20709">Friday</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20431">night</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-20569">Frederique</span>

One dead, <span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20785">missing</span> as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One <span class="marked id-unique-20782">person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span> at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-20743">First</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20751">Bernard</span> Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-20853">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-20853">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-20824">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-20849">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-20866">patio</span>.
"It was <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> an apocalyptic vision," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-20777">burns</span> to his right <span class="marked id-unique-20855">arm</span>.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-20800">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-20866">patio</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20852">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-20859">death</span> of one <span class="marked id-unique-20782">person</span> in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-20821">subsequent</span> explosions that shot <span class="marked id-unique-20856">flames</span> hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-20860">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-20854">evening</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20833">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20825">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20862">Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-20832">provincial</span> police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-20807">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-20839">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20820">destroyed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20863">30</span> buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-20827">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as <span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-20841">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-20791">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for <span class="marked id-unique-20829">safety</span>, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-20851">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-20754">towering</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20856">flames</span> lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-20747">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> he knows <span class="marked id-unique-20755">three</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-20785">missing</span> people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-20868">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span>.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-20743">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> and he could feel the heat of the <span class="marked id-unique-20856">flames</span> a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-20749">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span>, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:<span class="marked id-unique-20863">30</span> a.m., scorched his <span class="marked id-unique-20855">arm</span>. He
<span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-20849">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-20852">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>
the town centre, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20748">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20874">bars</span>, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-20846">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-20851">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was <span class="marked id-unique-20867">outside</span> his house <span class="marked id-unique-20789">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
<span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> he had to <span class="marked id-unique-20835">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-20810">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-20845">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-20806">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-20802">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-20783">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-20811">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20775">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-20796">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20765">operator</span>,
the <span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span> train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-20826">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20750">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20786">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-20799">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20828">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-20830">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20788">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-20804">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-20780">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-20787">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-20817">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20781">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20752">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-20780">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20750">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-20831">think</span> the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-20781">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20752">applied</span> on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-20746">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-20770">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20829">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20762">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20848">years</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>. "Well,
I <span class="marked id-unique-20831">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20746">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20778">blown</span> it here."

<span class="marked id-unique-20741">Like</span> a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20858">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-20784">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-20819">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-20792">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-20838">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20843">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train <span class="marked id-unique-20867">outside</span>
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>
there are <span class="marked id-unique-20760">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-20840">everything</span> by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-20830">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
<span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation <span class="marked id-unique-20829">Safety</span> Board of Canada is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-20871">black</span> box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-20832">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  <span class="marked id-unique-20833">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20862">Lapointe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-20844">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20822">started</span> before the train
<span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-20774">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-20862">Lapointe</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-20814">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-20808">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-20747">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We <span class="marked id-unique-20857">can</span> still see a <span class="marked id-unique-20850">lot</span> of
<span class="marked id-unique-20871">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-20783">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> Leonard <span class="marked id-unique-20873">Bedard</span>, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-20768">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through <span class="marked id-unique-20864">towns</span>. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

<span class="marked id-unique-20873">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> that is "mostly businesses <span class="marked id-unique-20820">destroyed</span>, but about
<span class="marked id-unique-20863">30</span> to 40 houses as well. I <span class="marked id-unique-20869">hope</span> they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-20842">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
<span class="marked id-unique-20785">missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-20832">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-20833">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20801">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20812">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-20751">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20744">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-20784">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-20749">home</span>.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-20823">morning</span> (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-20872">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-20815">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20813">bomb</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-20803">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-20870">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20818">afraid</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-20854">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-20850">lot</span> of people there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-20872">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span>. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-20809">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-20790">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-20764">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-20744">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-20848">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "<span class="marked id-unique-20870">Everybody</span> is very
friendly ... It's <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-20865">Red</span> Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-20771">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20865">Red</span> Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-20758">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-20767">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-20753">want</span> us to." Beauchesne <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-20783">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-20776">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-20772">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-20834">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-20837">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-20836">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-20847">added</span>: “We <span class="marked id-unique-20869">hope</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20805">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20857">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20794">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-20793">safely</span> and quickly. The

the <span class="marked id-unique-20797">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-20748">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-20773">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-20868">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>. “When you <span class="marked id-unique-20831">think</span> of that,

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-20808">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20811">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span> in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-20820">destroyed</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-20864">town's</span> center and killed at
least one <span class="marked id-unique-20782">person</span>. Police <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-20859">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-20851">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-20754">towering</span>
fireballs and a <span class="marked id-unique-20865">red</span> glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-20747">sky</span>,
witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20856">Flames</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20814">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20871">black</span> smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-20767">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-20828">73-car</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-20824">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-20841">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20832">provincial</span> police <span class="marked id-unique-20833">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20801">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20812">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one <span class="marked id-unique-20782">person</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-20842">died</span>. He refused to say how <span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20800">others</span>
might be dead, but <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span>"
people have been reported <span class="marked id-unique-20785">missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20833">Lt</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-20825">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20862">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-20832">provincial</span>
police, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>: "I <span class="marked id-unique-20773">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20753">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-20807">deceased</span> unfortunately."

<span class="marked id-unique-20862">Lapointe</span> refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-20771">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-20785">missing</span>, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-20789">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20755">three</span> times <span class="marked id-unique-20785">missing</span> by different
members of the family," he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-20748">popular</span> area packed with <span class="marked id-unique-20874">bars</span> that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20743">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-20820">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-20775">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-20796">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20765">operator</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-20786">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-20799">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the
train had been <span class="marked id-unique-20830">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20788">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-20817">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20781">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20752">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-20780">run</span> away," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20826">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20750">Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-20831">think</span> the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-20781">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20752">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-20750">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the
train was <span class="marked id-unique-20830">parked</span> because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-20804">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-20780">run</span>.

"<span class="marked id-unique-20746">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-20770">good</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20829">safety</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20762">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-20848">years</span>,"
he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I <span class="marked id-unique-20831">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20746">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20778">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-20845">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-20863">30</span>
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span>
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-20849">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-20768">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-20823">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20747">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20751">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was <span class="marked id-unique-20867">outside</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-20874">bar's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20866">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the <span class="marked id-unique-20829">safety</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-20868">inside</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-20748">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-20743">first</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-20822">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> a movie," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-20777">burns</span>
on his right <span class="marked id-unique-20855">arm</span>.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

<span class="marked id-unique-20783">Firefighters</span>, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-20844">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-20827">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-20760">security</span> perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-20745">many</span> feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the <span class="marked id-unique-20864">town's</span> main
street, <span class="marked id-unique-20856">flames</span> danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-20854">evening</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-20850">lot</span> of people there," <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20751">Bernard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20744">Demers</span>, who
<span class="marked id-unique-20784">owns</span> a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-20846">blast</span> site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-20872">big</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span>. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-20809">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-20790">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-20764">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-20744">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-20852">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-20749">home</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> was "<span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-20815">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20813">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-20803">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-20870">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-20818">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-20853">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-20749">home</span> after an <span class="marked id-unique-20740">explosion</span> went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came <span class="marked id-unique-20741">like</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-20839">fireball</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>.

Another resident Claude <span class="marked id-unique-20873">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-20802">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-20806">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-20840">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-20835">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-20847">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-20860">air</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-20783">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-20791">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

<span class="marked id-unique-20783">Firefighters</span> from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-20772">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-20836">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-20834">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-20837">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-20821">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span>.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-20869">hope</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20805">evacuees</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20857">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20794">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-20793">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-20756">surrounding</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20875">areas</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20857">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20761">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20779">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-20769">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-20766">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-20759">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-20757">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-20763">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-20798">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-20816">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-20795">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-20797">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company <span class="marked id-unique-20784">owns</span> more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-20819">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-20792">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-20838">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-20843">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products <span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span>
in <span class="marked id-unique-20776">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The <span class="marked id-unique-20861">derailed</span> rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-20787">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-20858">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-20810">car</span> holds some <span class="marked id-unique-20863">30</span>,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-20774">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the <span class="marked id-unique-20875">areas</span> where the trains
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-20758">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren <span class="marked id-unique-20742">said</span> recently.

One <span class="marked id-unique-24659">dead</span>, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-24659">dead</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-24643">driverless</span>
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-24640">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-24643">driverless</span>
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-24614">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-24624">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-24647">patio</span>.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-24616">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-24647">patio</span> fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-24606">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-24622">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24625">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-24655">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-24652">destroyed</span> 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-24644">businesses</span> and left <span class="marked id-unique-24650">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-24634">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-24648">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-24618">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-24611">crowded</span> when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-24629">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-24621">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
<span class="marked id-unique-24649">fires</span>, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-24615">railway's</span> operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-24638">runaway</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-24626">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-24658">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-24641">Somehow</span> it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-24612">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-24610">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-24646">zone</span>: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-24639">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-24613">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-24633">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24636">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-24607">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-24657">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-24654">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-24658">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-24641">somehow</span>,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-24654">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-24635">Canada</span> is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-24651">black</span> box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-24640">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-24656">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-24623">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a <span class="marked id-unique-24617">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke <span class="marked id-unique-24619">continued</span> to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-24651">black</span> smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-24644">businesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24652">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-24657">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-24645">Early</span> this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-24620">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small <span class="marked id-unique-24627">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-24657">set</span> up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-24609">reached</span> by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a <span class="marked id-unique-24653">local</span> school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them <span class="marked id-unique-24642">get</span>
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-24608">continue</span> to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-24628">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24632">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-24630">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-24637">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular <span class="marked id-unique-24653">local</span> singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-24648">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-24631">Press</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-24635">Canada</span> train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll <span class="marked id-unique-24657">set</span> to rise

Deaths feared in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-24620">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-24659">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-24638">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-24655">fireball</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24651">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-24650">Dozens</span> of buildings were <span class="marked id-unique-24652">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-24634">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for <span class="marked id-unique-24650">dozens</span> of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-24645">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-24639">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-24627">village</span> before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-24623">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24614">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-24643">driverless</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-24609">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-24640">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
<span class="marked id-unique-24608">continue</span> at dawn.

<span class="marked id-unique-24653">Local</span> media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-24616">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24625">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-24656">blaze</span>, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-24619">continued</span> for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-24611">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the <span class="marked id-unique-24656">blaze</span> for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-24647">patio</span> of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-24606">lucky</span> to escape and feared for
those <span class="marked id-unique-24648">inside</span> the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
<span class="marked id-unique-24631">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-24621">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-24612">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-24618">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24617">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the <span class="marked id-unique-24627">village</span> of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-24610">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-24615">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-24626">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-24658">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a <span class="marked id-unique-24653">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24607">hotel</span> for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-24641">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-24654">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-24655">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-24644">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-24646">zone</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24657">set</span> up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-24652">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-24642">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-24630">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-24628">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24632">prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-24622">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24649">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-24629">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-24657">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-24637">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track <span class="marked id-unique-24613">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24633">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24636">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-24624">lakeside</span> town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-24674">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-24670">high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with <span class="marked id-unique-24674">tankers</span> of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-24675">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-24713">afternoon</span> police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-24701">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24689">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-24681">deceased</span>." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-24661">shock</span> wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-24710">businesses</span> and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-24686">tracks</span> that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-24694">kilometre</span> away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-24709">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-24708">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-24703">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-24673">two</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24679">kilometres</span> from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-24692">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-24686">tracks</span>, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-24682">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-24690">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24711">Burkhardt</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24697">chief</span>
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-24671">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-24678">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-24691">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-24672">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-24680">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-24714">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-24684">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24715">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24712">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-24714">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-24711">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-24715">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24712">applied</span> on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-24700">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-24685">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24679">kilometres</span> of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-24693">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24699">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-24704">Vermont</span>.

"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-24698">Canada</span> is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-24663">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24660">videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had <span class="marked id-unique-24687">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-24669">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-24713">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
<span class="marked id-unique-24694">kilometre</span> away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-24705">trains</span> carrying

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-24710">businesses</span> destroyed, but about

provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in <span class="marked id-unique-24661">shock</span> following a

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24706">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-24710">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-24698">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-24701">death</span> toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-24681">deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24689">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews <span class="marked id-unique-24696">couldn't</span> reach a section
of the town due to fears that <span class="marked id-unique-24709">five</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-24674">tankers</span> cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-24709">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24674">tankers</span> with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-24683">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-24676">requested</span> any
<span class="marked id-unique-24708">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-24697">chief</span> Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-24677">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-24707">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-24671">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-24678">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-24690">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24711">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-24672">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-24711">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-24684">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24715">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24712">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-24714">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-24715">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24712">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-24680">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-24714">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-24691">73-car</span> train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-24662">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-24669">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late <span class="marked id-unique-24665">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-24673">two</span>
town centres are about 12 <span class="marked id-unique-24679">kilometres</span> apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-24707">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-24688">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-24687">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24675">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-24686">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-24705">train's</span> engine was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-24694">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-24704">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24693">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24699">Brunswick</span> and owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-24685">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24679">kilometres</span>
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-24686">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-24703">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-24670">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-24663">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24660">videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-24700">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular <span class="marked id-unique-24702">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-24666">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24664">group</span> was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-24708">help</span> track down
residents who <span class="marked id-unique-24696">couldn't</span> immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-24667">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-24668">phone</span>.
The Red <span class="marked id-unique-24695">Cross</span> had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-24713">afternoon</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-24692">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-24801">First</span>, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-24818">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-24818">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-24780">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-24812">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-24740">burns</span> to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-24757">others</span> on the
patio <span class="marked id-unique-24817">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-24803">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-24777">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-24804">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-24820">evening</span>, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24781">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-24819">expect</span> there
will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-24816">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24764">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-24791">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-24783">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-24793">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-24748">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-24814">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-24717">towering</span> flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-24810">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows <span class="marked id-unique-24718">three</span> of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-24801">first</span> explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-24815">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-24812">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-24817">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many <span class="marked id-unique-24811">popular</span> bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-24798">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-24814">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-24746">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-24786">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-24767">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-24797">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-24763">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-24759">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-24768">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-24738">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-24753">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24728">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-24782">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-24743">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-24756">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-24784">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-24745">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-24761">finished</span>
his run. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-24744">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-24774">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-24806">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-24733">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-24725">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-24805">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-24806">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24741">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-24800">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-24776">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-24749">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-24790">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24795">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-24807">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-24723">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-24792">everything</span> by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-24796">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-24778">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-24737">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-24771">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-24765">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-24810">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a <span class="marked id-unique-24813">lot</span> of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-24731">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-24808">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-24794">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24758">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24769">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-24802">Demers</span>, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-24815">home</span>.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-24779">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-24772">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24770">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-24760">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-24775">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-24820">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-24813">lot</span> of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-24766">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-24747">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-24727">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-24802">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-24805">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-24734">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-24721">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-24730">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-24716">want</span> us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24809">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-24739">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-24735">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-24785">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24789">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-24787">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-24799">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-24762">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-24751">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-24750">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-24719">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-24724">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24742">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-24732">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-24729">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24722">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-24720">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-24726">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-24755">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-24773">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24752">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-24754">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-24811">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-24736">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-24788">Press</span>

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-24765">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24768">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-24803">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-24814">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-24717">towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-24810">sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-24771">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-24730">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-24784">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-24780">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-24793">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24758">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24769">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-24794">died</span>. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-24757">others</span>
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24781">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-24736">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24716">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-24819">expect</span> we'll have other people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-24816">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24764">deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-24734">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-24746">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24718">three</span> times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-24811">popular</span> area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-24801">first</span> explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-24738">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-24753">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24728">operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-24743">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-24756">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-24745">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-24774">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-24782">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-24761">finished</span> his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-24806">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-24733">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-24725">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-24805">years</span>,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-24806">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24741">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-24797">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-24812">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-24731">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-24779">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24810">sky</span>.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the <span class="marked id-unique-24811">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-24801">first</span> explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-24778">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-24740">burns</span>
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-24796">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-24783">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-24723">security</span> perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-24820">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-24813">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-24802">Demers</span>, who
owns a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-24798">blast</span> site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-24766">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-24747">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-24727">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-24802">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-24817">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-24815">home</span>, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-24772">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24770">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24760">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-24775">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-24818">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-24815">home</span> after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-24791">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-24759">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-24763">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24792">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24786">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24799">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-24804">air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-24748">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24809">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-24735">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-24787">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-24785">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24789">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-24777">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-24762">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-24751">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-24750">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-24719">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-24724">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24742">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-24732">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-24729">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-24722">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-24720">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-24726">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-24755">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-24773">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24752">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-24754">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-24776">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-24749">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-24807">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-24790">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24795">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-24739">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-24744">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-24800">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-24767">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-24737">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-24808">trains</span>
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-24721">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren said recently.

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-24823">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-24853">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-24853">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
<span class="marked id-unique-24825">ball</span> of fire <span class="marked id-unique-24833">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-24855">afternoon</span> police
<span class="marked id-unique-24854">confirmed</span> the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-24852">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-24846">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-24831">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-24852">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-24848">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the <span class="marked id-unique-24856">accident</span> is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-24838">73-car</span> train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-24830">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-24845">Gazette</span> the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-24821">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before <span class="marked id-unique-24844">midnight</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24822">locked</span> the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then <span class="marked id-unique-24824">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "<span class="marked id-unique-24841">Sometime</span> after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-24835">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-24828">report</span> that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-24829">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, <span class="marked id-unique-24854">confirmed</span> last night that it had received
a call <span class="marked id-unique-24841">sometime</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-24844">midnight</span> about a <span class="marked id-unique-24851">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-24855">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-24849">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-24837">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a <span class="marked id-unique-24842">small</span> village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were <span class="marked id-unique-24826">160</span> firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24850">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-24839">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24843">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-24840">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-24847">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-24836">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-24834">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-24832">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-24827">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-24853">freight</span> train pulling tank cars full of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a <span class="marked id-unique-24842">small</span> Quebec town about <span class="marked id-unique-24826">160</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-24846">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities <span class="marked id-unique-24854">confirmed</span> the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not <span class="marked id-unique-24828">report</span> other injuries.

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-24845">Gazette</span>:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac

brakes and <span class="marked id-unique-24824">checked</span> to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " '<span class="marked id-unique-24841">Sometime</span> after (the first conductor <span class="marked id-unique-24852">left</span>),

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless

good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-24922">we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-24905">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24913">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-24880">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-24859">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-24862">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-24874">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-24857">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-24863">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-24926">somehow</span>,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-24864">released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety <span class="marked id-unique-24875">Board</span> of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-24925">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting <span class="marked id-unique-24910">eyewitness</span> accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-24878">report</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-24914">blaze</span> had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-24907">last</span> night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-24894">Billowing</span> smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-24906">never</span> allow <span class="marked id-unique-24923">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes <span class="marked id-unique-24876">absolutely</span>
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-24899">Worried</span>
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-24912">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24888">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24892">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-24873">can't</span> tell you at the moment
whether there are any <span class="marked id-unique-24858">victims</span> or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-24895">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24893">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-24890">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-24896">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-24920">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-24885">terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-24879">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24924">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on <span class="marked id-unique-24861">Twitter</span>.  “<span class="marked id-unique-24900">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24904">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-24870">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-24871">Horrible</span> news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-24902">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-24916">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the <span class="marked id-unique-24887">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-24877">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-24919">Canadian</span> Press

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-24866">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24919">Canadian</span> town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-24908">hundreds</span> of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-24882">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24925">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-24917">runaway</span> train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the <span class="marked id-unique-24865">rails</span> shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-24897">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-24909">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-24894">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-24921">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-24884">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-24898">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-24911">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-24881">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-24877">six</span>
loud <span class="marked id-unique-24915">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-24914">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-24899">Worried</span> residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-24912">died</span> in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-24860">unable</span>
to reach family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-24879">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-24907">last</span> night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are <span class="marked id-unique-24899">worried</span>
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-24873">can't</span> give out any information on what's happening
<span class="marked id-unique-24918">right</span> now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24916">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24888">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24892">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-24876">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24868">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-24858">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-24922">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24924">Stephen</span> Harper took to <span class="marked id-unique-24861">Twitter</span> to release
an <span class="marked id-unique-24869">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24902">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-24900">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24904">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-24870">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic. <span class="marked id-unique-24871">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24905">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24913">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-24859">vice-president</span> of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-24880">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on <span class="marked id-unique-24875">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-24872">distance</span> from the
town during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-24883">driver</span> shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-24862">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-24874">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-24857">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-24863">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-24926">Somehow</span> the train got <span class="marked id-unique-24864">released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full <span class="marked id-unique-24878">report</span> yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-24910">Eyewitness</span> Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he <span class="marked id-unique-24903">saw</span> the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-24906">never</span> seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-24903">saw</span> the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-24885">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-24922">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24906">never</span> seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-24889">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-24891">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-24867">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-24895">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24893">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24890">hot</span>. Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-24896">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-24923">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-24918">Right</span> now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24901">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-24886">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an <span class="marked id-unique-24920">area</span> popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-24887">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-25150">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been <span class="marked id-unique-25074">declared</span> dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the <span class="marked id-unique-25144">heart</span> of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-25040">heard</span> the
now <span class="marked id-unique-25042">haunting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24988">rattle</span> of an <span class="marked id-unique-25103">approaching</span> train. Then he felt
the <span class="marked id-unique-25146">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24972">shake</span>.  But it <span class="marked id-unique-24936">wasn't</span> until the driverless
freight train, <span class="marked id-unique-25029">laden</span> with tankers of <span class="marked id-unique-24938">volatile</span> crude oil,
<span class="marked id-unique-25141">hurtled</span> off the track that he <span class="marked id-unique-25033">instantly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25000">perceived</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-25077">danger</span> he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the <span class="marked id-unique-25064">enormous</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25161">ball</span> of fire rolling <span class="marked id-unique-24947">towards</span> the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-25130">picturesque</span> lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were <span class="marked id-unique-25065">enjoying</span> a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-24958">summer's</span> night on the patio.
"It was like an <span class="marked id-unique-25104">apocalyptic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24939">vision</span>," said Theberge, <span class="marked id-unique-25113">44</span>,
who <span class="marked id-unique-24959">suffered</span> burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-25136">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that <span class="marked id-unique-24970">shot</span> flames hundreds of <span class="marked id-unique-25015">metres</span>
into the air and <span class="marked id-unique-25028">laid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24935">waste</span> to downtown Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-25036">However</span>, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was <span class="marked id-unique-25126">saying</span> authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-25124">shock</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24933">wave</span> from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, <span class="marked id-unique-25045">gutted</span> downtown businesses and left dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-25001">people
- possibly</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-25110">60 - unaccounted</span> for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to <span class="marked id-unique-24975">scramble</span> for safety, <span class="marked id-unique-25051">fleeing</span> the intense heat
as the towering flames <span class="marked id-unique-25023">lit</span> up the night sky.  Theberge,
who <span class="marked id-unique-24929">works</span> at the Musi-Cafe, said he <span class="marked id-unique-25030">knows</span> three of the
missing people: <span class="marked id-unique-25055">fellow</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25152">employees</span> who haven't <span class="marked id-unique-24982">responded</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-24984">repeated</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24954">telephone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25090">calls</span>. While he and his <span class="marked id-unique-25002">pals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25062">escaped</span>,
those inside the restaurant may have been <span class="marked id-unique-24945">trapped</span> in an
inferno.  The restaurant, <span class="marked id-unique-25159">beside</span> the railway tracks that
<span class="marked id-unique-25132">pass</span> right through the <span class="marked id-unique-25144">heart</span> of downtown, is <span class="marked id-unique-25066">emerging</span> in
eyewitness <span class="marked id-unique-25162">accounts</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-25146">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24927">zero</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25076">deadly</span> explosion.
<span class="marked id-unique-24928">Yannick</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25147">Gagne</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25133">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-25120">unable</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25081">contact</span> some <span class="marked id-unique-25152">employees</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-25147">Gagne</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-24990">radio</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24963">station</span> he left the restaurant about 20 <span class="marked id-unique-25014">minutes</span> before the
first explosion and he could <span class="marked id-unique-25056">feel</span> the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-25039">hopped</span> on his <span class="marked id-unique-25095">bicycle</span>
and got to what he <span class="marked id-unique-24950">thought</span> was a <span class="marked id-unique-24978">safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25153">distance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25099">away -
until</span> the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., <span class="marked id-unique-24976">scorched</span> his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-25134">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
help those who <span class="marked id-unique-25044">hadn't</span> fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train <span class="marked id-unique-25050">flew</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-25129">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-25139">initial</span> blast was so intense that <span class="marked id-unique-24980">Roger</span> Beauchesne,
who was outside his <span class="marked id-unique-25038">house</span> two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take <span class="marked id-unique-25079">cover</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25160">behind</span> his car to <span class="marked id-unique-24992">protect</span> himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the <span class="marked id-unique-25007">municipal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25024">library</span>,
which is <span class="marked id-unique-25159">beside</span> the railway tracks, was <span class="marked id-unique-25106">among</span> the buildings
<span class="marked id-unique-25073">demolished</span> by the blasts, <span class="marked id-unique-25107">along</span> with Dollarama and the
Metro <span class="marked id-unique-25046">grocery</span>. Late Saturday firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-25101">assisted</span> by
<span class="marked id-unique-24966">specialists</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-24941">Ultramar</span> were still <span class="marked id-unique-25098">battling</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24998">persistent</span>
fires, burning <span class="marked id-unique-25071">despite</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-24961">steady</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25067">drizzle</span>.

The cause of the accident is itself <span class="marked id-unique-24943">turning</span> out to be
<span class="marked id-unique-24960">stranger</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-25054">fiction</span>. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
<span class="marked id-unique-25060">executive</span> of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it <span class="marked id-unique-25041">headed</span> into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on <span class="marked id-unique-25058">fatal</span> train derailment

The <span class="marked id-unique-25115">10-year-old</span> railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-25119">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-25123">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before midnight and <span class="marked id-unique-25138">locked</span> the brakes, <span class="marked id-unique-25063">ensuring</span>
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-25125">secured</span>. He then <span class="marked id-unique-25155">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25142">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It <span class="marked id-unique-24944">travelled</span> under
its own <span class="marked id-unique-25035">inertia</span> to the centre of the town." He said
there are security <span class="marked id-unique-25017">mechanisms</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-24994">prevent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24956">tampering</span> with
the train, and the conductor had <span class="marked id-unique-25069">done</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24993">proper</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25087">checks</span>
before <span class="marked id-unique-25026">leaving</span> the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in <span class="marked id-unique-25009">motion</span>.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-25122">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-25157">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-25116">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-25127">relief</span> ... somehow,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-25128">released</span>," McGonigle told <span class="marked id-unique-24981">Reuters</span>.
"<span class="marked id-unique-24952">That's</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-25083">confuses</span> us. How did this <span class="marked id-unique-25043">happen</span>? There are
many <span class="marked id-unique-25059">fail-safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25013">modes</span>. How this happened is just <span class="marked id-unique-25096">beyond</span>
us." The <span class="marked id-unique-24946">Transportation</span> Safety <span class="marked id-unique-25158">Board</span> of Canada is <span class="marked id-unique-25137">looking</span>
for the black <span class="marked id-unique-25093">box</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25084">confirm</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25070">direction</span> and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are <span class="marked id-unique-25082">considering</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-24995">possible</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25078">criminal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25031">investigation</span>.  Lt. Lapointe said
<span class="marked id-unique-25003">officers</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-25086">collecting</span> eyewitness <span class="marked id-unique-25162">accounts</span> as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-25131">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25117">videos</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-25089">cellphones</span>.  They are also <span class="marked id-unique-25137">looking</span>
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a <span class="marked id-unique-24971">short</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25068">drive</span> from town, confirmed last night that it had <span class="marked id-unique-24986">received</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-25091">call</span> sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just <span class="marked id-unique-25126">saying</span> it's one of the <span class="marked id-unique-24996">possibilities</span>," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to <span class="marked id-unique-25052">fill</span>
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and <span class="marked id-unique-25021">lots</span> of firefighters. This is so <span class="marked id-unique-24979">saddening</span>
to see," said <span class="marked id-unique-25025">Leonard</span> Bedard, <span class="marked id-unique-25109">80</span>, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never <span class="marked id-unique-25108">allow</span> trains carrying
that <span class="marked id-unique-25008">much</span> oil to <span class="marked id-unique-25132">pass</span> through towns. It <span class="marked id-unique-25135">makes</span> absolutely
no <span class="marked id-unique-24974">sense</span>, and it <span class="marked id-unique-25135">makes</span> me <span class="marked id-unique-25105">angry</span>."

Bedard said that is "<span class="marked id-unique-25010">mostly</span> businesses destroyed, but about
30 to <span class="marked id-unique-25114">40</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25037">houses</span> as well. I hope they <span class="marked id-unique-24987">rebuild</span>." Worried
residents <span class="marked id-unique-24934">watched</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-25160">behind</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24999">perimeters</span> set up by
authorities, <span class="marked id-unique-24969">sick</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-25057">fear</span> that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on <span class="marked id-unique-24940">vacation</span>,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told <span class="marked id-unique-24983">reporters</span>. "We're
<span class="marked id-unique-25088">checking</span> all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-25156">can't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24953">tell</span> you at the <span class="marked id-unique-25012">moment</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24932">whether</span> there are any <span class="marked id-unique-25118">victims</span> or people who are <span class="marked id-unique-25034">injured</span>."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
<span class="marked id-unique-25151">evacuated</span> from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was <span class="marked id-unique-25092">bustling</span> as the train <span class="marked id-unique-25141">hurtled</span> in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has <span class="marked id-unique-25022">lived</span> in Lac-Megantic for <span class="marked id-unique-25112">45</span> years,
<span class="marked id-unique-25072">describes</span> it as a "<span class="marked id-unique-25005">nice</span> town." "Everybody is very
<span class="marked id-unique-25047">friendly</span> ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it <span class="marked id-unique-24931">won't</span> be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-25149">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25145">group</span>
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About <span class="marked id-unique-25111">450</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-25151">evacuated</span> residents are <span class="marked id-unique-24962">staying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-24997">Polyvalente</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25011">Montignac</span>,
a local <span class="marked id-unique-24977">school</span>, where 20 <span class="marked id-unique-24937">volunteers</span> from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
<span class="marked id-unique-24973">settled</span> in, <span class="marked id-unique-24991">providing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25049">food</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25097">beds</span>, as well as helping
them getting in <span class="marked id-unique-24948">touch</span> with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman <span class="marked id-unique-25006">Myriam</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25019">Marotte</span>. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-25154">continue</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25102">assist</span>
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and <span class="marked id-unique-24951">there's</span>
a "<span class="marked id-unique-24955">team</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24965">spirit</span>" in the town and “<span class="marked id-unique-25061">everyone</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-24930">working</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24949">together</span>.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was <span class="marked id-unique-25100">attending</span> the Calgary <span class="marked id-unique-24964">Stampede</span>, expressed his <span class="marked id-unique-25085">concern</span>
on <span class="marked id-unique-25121">Twitter</span>.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those <span class="marked id-unique-25140">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he <span class="marked id-unique-24942">tweeted</span>. “<span class="marked id-unique-25143">Horrible</span> news.” In
a statement <span class="marked id-unique-25027">later</span>, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” <span class="marked id-unique-25018">Meanwhile</span>, some <span class="marked id-unique-25080">counted</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-25094">blessings</span>
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-25148">Friday</span> night.  <span class="marked id-unique-25048">Frederique</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25020">Mailloux</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24957">supposed</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25016">meet</span> up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local <span class="marked id-unique-24968">singer</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-25032">Instead</span>,
it was one of the <span class="marked id-unique-24989">rare</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25004">occasions</span> she <span class="marked id-unique-25075">decided</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-24967">skip</span> a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are <span class="marked id-unique-24985">relieved</span>.” With <span class="marked id-unique-25053">files</span> from Canadian Press

One dead, many missing as train <span class="marked id-unique-25150">explodes</span> in Lac-Megantic
One person has been <span class="marked id-unique-25074">declared</span> dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the <span class="marked id-unique-25144">heart</span> of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-25040">heard</span> the
now <span class="marked id-unique-25042">haunting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24988">rattle</span> of an <span class="marked id-unique-25103">approaching</span> train. Then he felt
the <span class="marked id-unique-25146">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24972">shake</span>.  But it <span class="marked id-unique-24936">wasn't</span> until the driverless
freight train, <span class="marked id-unique-25029">laden</span> with tankers of <span class="marked id-unique-24938">volatile</span> crude oil,
<span class="marked id-unique-25141">hurtled</span> off the track that he <span class="marked id-unique-25033">instantly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25000">perceived</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-25077">danger</span> he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the <span class="marked id-unique-25064">enormous</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25161">ball</span> of fire rolling <span class="marked id-unique-24947">towards</span> the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-25130">picturesque</span> lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were <span class="marked id-unique-25065">enjoying</span> a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-24958">summer's</span> night on the patio.
"It was like an <span class="marked id-unique-25104">apocalyptic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24939">vision</span>," said Theberge, <span class="marked id-unique-25113">44</span>,
who <span class="marked id-unique-24959">suffered</span> burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-25136">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that <span class="marked id-unique-24970">shot</span> flames hundreds of <span class="marked id-unique-25015">metres</span>
into the air and <span class="marked id-unique-25028">laid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24935">waste</span> to downtown Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-25036">However</span>, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was <span class="marked id-unique-25126">saying</span> authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-25124">shock</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24933">wave</span> from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, <span class="marked id-unique-25045">gutted</span> downtown businesses and left dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-25001">people
- possibly</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-25110">60 - unaccounted</span> for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to <span class="marked id-unique-24975">scramble</span> for safety, <span class="marked id-unique-25051">fleeing</span> the intense heat
as the towering flames <span class="marked id-unique-25023">lit</span> up the night sky.  Theberge,
who <span class="marked id-unique-24929">works</span> at the Musi-Cafe, said he <span class="marked id-unique-25030">knows</span> three of the
missing people: <span class="marked id-unique-25055">fellow</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25152">employees</span> who haven't <span class="marked id-unique-24982">responded</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-24984">repeated</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24954">telephone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25090">calls</span>. While he and his <span class="marked id-unique-25002">pals</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25062">escaped</span>,
those inside the restaurant may have been <span class="marked id-unique-24945">trapped</span> in an
inferno.  The restaurant, <span class="marked id-unique-25159">beside</span> the railway tracks that
<span class="marked id-unique-25132">pass</span> right through the <span class="marked id-unique-25144">heart</span> of downtown, is <span class="marked id-unique-25066">emerging</span> in
eyewitness <span class="marked id-unique-25162">accounts</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-25146">ground</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24927">zero</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-25076">deadly</span> explosion.
<span class="marked id-unique-24928">Yannick</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25147">Gagne</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25133">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-25120">unable</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25081">contact</span> some <span class="marked id-unique-25152">employees</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-25147">Gagne</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-24990">radio</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24963">station</span> he left the restaurant about 20 <span class="marked id-unique-25014">minutes</span> before the
first explosion and he could <span class="marked id-unique-25056">feel</span> the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-25039">hopped</span> on his <span class="marked id-unique-25095">bicycle</span>
and got to what he <span class="marked id-unique-24950">thought</span> was a <span class="marked id-unique-24978">safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25153">distance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25099">away -
until</span> the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., <span class="marked id-unique-24976">scorched</span> his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-25134">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
help those who <span class="marked id-unique-25044">hadn't</span> fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train <span class="marked id-unique-25050">flew</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-25129">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-25139">initial</span> blast was so intense that <span class="marked id-unique-24980">Roger</span> Beauchesne,
who was outside his <span class="marked id-unique-25038">house</span> two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take <span class="marked id-unique-25079">cover</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25160">behind</span> his car to <span class="marked id-unique-24992">protect</span> himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the <span class="marked id-unique-25007">municipal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25024">library</span>,
which is <span class="marked id-unique-25159">beside</span> the railway tracks, was <span class="marked id-unique-25106">among</span> the buildings
<span class="marked id-unique-25073">demolished</span> by the blasts, <span class="marked id-unique-25107">along</span> with Dollarama and the
Metro <span class="marked id-unique-25046">grocery</span>. Late Saturday firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-25101">assisted</span> by
<span class="marked id-unique-24966">specialists</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-24941">Ultramar</span> were still <span class="marked id-unique-25098">battling</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24998">persistent</span>
fires, burning <span class="marked id-unique-25071">despite</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-24961">steady</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25067">drizzle</span>.

The cause of the accident is itself <span class="marked id-unique-24943">turning</span> out to be
<span class="marked id-unique-24960">stranger</span> than <span class="marked id-unique-25054">fiction</span>. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
<span class="marked id-unique-25060">executive</span> of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it <span class="marked id-unique-25041">headed</span> into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on <span class="marked id-unique-25058">fatal</span> train derailment

The <span class="marked id-unique-25115">10-year-old</span> railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-25119">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor <span class="marked id-unique-25123">stopped</span> the train outside
town just before midnight and <span class="marked id-unique-25138">locked</span> the brakes, <span class="marked id-unique-25063">ensuring</span>
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-25125">secured</span>. He then <span class="marked id-unique-25155">checked</span> into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-25142">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It <span class="marked id-unique-24944">travelled</span> under
its own <span class="marked id-unique-25035">inertia</span> to the centre of the town." He said
there are security <span class="marked id-unique-25017">mechanisms</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-24994">prevent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24956">tampering</span> with
the train, and the conductor had <span class="marked id-unique-25069">done</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24993">proper</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25087">checks</span>
before <span class="marked id-unique-25026">leaving</span> the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in <span class="marked id-unique-25009">motion</span>.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-25122">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-25157">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-25116">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-25127">relief</span> ... somehow,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-25128">released</span>," McGonigle told <span class="marked id-unique-24981">Reuters</span>.
"<span class="marked id-unique-24952">That's</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-25083">confuses</span> us. How did this <span class="marked id-unique-25043">happen</span>? There are
many <span class="marked id-unique-25059">fail-safe</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25013">modes</span>. How this happened is just <span class="marked id-unique-25096">beyond</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-25003">officers</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-25086">collecting</span> eyewitness <span class="marked id-unique-25162">accounts</span> as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-25131">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25117">videos</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-25089">cellphones</span>.  They are also <span class="marked id-unique-25137">looking</span>
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a <span class="marked id-unique-24971">short</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25068">drive</span> from town, confirmed last night that it had <span class="marked id-unique-24986">received</span>
a <span class="marked id-unique-25091">call</span> sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just <span class="marked id-unique-25126">saying</span> it's one of the <span class="marked id-unique-24996">possibilities</span>," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to <span class="marked id-unique-25052">fill</span>
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and <span class="marked id-unique-25021">lots</span> of firefighters. This is so <span class="marked id-unique-24979">saddening</span>

Bedard said that is "<span class="marked id-unique-25010">mostly</span> businesses destroyed, but about
30 to <span class="marked id-unique-25114">40</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25037">houses</span> as well. I hope they <span class="marked id-unique-24987">rebuild</span>." Worried
residents <span class="marked id-unique-24934">watched</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-25160">behind</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24999">perimeters</span> set up by
authorities, <span class="marked id-unique-24969">sick</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-25057">fear</span> that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on <span class="marked id-unique-24940">vacation</span>,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told <span class="marked id-unique-24983">reporters</span>. "We're
<span class="marked id-unique-25088">checking</span> all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-25156">can't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24953">tell</span> you at the <span class="marked id-unique-25012">moment</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24932">whether</span> there are any <span class="marked id-unique-25118">victims</span> or people who are <span class="marked id-unique-25034">injured</span>."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
<span class="marked id-unique-25151">evacuated</span> from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was <span class="marked id-unique-25092">bustling</span> as the train <span class="marked id-unique-25141">hurtled</span> in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has <span class="marked id-unique-25022">lived</span> in Lac-Megantic for <span class="marked id-unique-25112">45</span> years,
<span class="marked id-unique-25072">describes</span> it as a "<span class="marked id-unique-25005">nice</span> town." "Everybody is very
<span class="marked id-unique-25047">friendly</span> ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it <span class="marked id-unique-24931">won't</span> be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-25149">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25145">group</span>
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About <span class="marked id-unique-25111">450</span> of the
<span class="marked id-unique-25151">evacuated</span> residents are <span class="marked id-unique-24962">staying</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-24997">Polyvalente</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25011">Montignac</span>,
a local <span class="marked id-unique-24977">school</span>, where 20 <span class="marked id-unique-24937">volunteers</span> from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
<span class="marked id-unique-24973">settled</span> in, <span class="marked id-unique-24991">providing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25049">food</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25097">beds</span>, as well as helping
them getting in <span class="marked id-unique-24948">touch</span> with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman <span class="marked id-unique-25006">Myriam</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25019">Marotte</span>. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-25154">continue</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25102">assist</span>
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and <span class="marked id-unique-24951">there's</span>
a "<span class="marked id-unique-24955">team</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24965">spirit</span>" in the town and “<span class="marked id-unique-25061">everyone</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-24930">working</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24949">together</span>.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was <span class="marked id-unique-25100">attending</span> the Calgary <span class="marked id-unique-24964">Stampede</span>, expressed his <span class="marked id-unique-25085">concern</span>
on <span class="marked id-unique-25121">Twitter</span>.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those <span class="marked id-unique-25140">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he <span class="marked id-unique-24942">tweeted</span>. “<span class="marked id-unique-25143">Horrible</span> news.” In
a statement <span class="marked id-unique-25027">later</span>, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” <span class="marked id-unique-25018">Meanwhile</span>, some <span class="marked id-unique-25080">counted</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-25094">blessings</span>
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-25148">Friday</span> night.  <span class="marked id-unique-25048">Frederique</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25020">Mailloux</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24957">supposed</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25016">meet</span> up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local <span class="marked id-unique-24968">singer</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-25032">Instead</span>,
it was one of the <span class="marked id-unique-24989">rare</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25004">occasions</span> she <span class="marked id-unique-25075">decided</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-24967">skip</span> a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are <span class="marked id-unique-24985">relieved</span>.” With <span class="marked id-unique-25053">files</span> from Canadian Press

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-<span class="marked id-unique-25247">First</span>, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he <span class="marked id-unique-25264">felt</span>
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and <span class="marked id-unique-25264">felt</span> the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-25227">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other <span class="marked id-unique-25258">patrons</span>
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered <span class="marked id-unique-25187">burns</span> to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-25204">others</span> on the
patio <span class="marked id-unique-25263">fled</span>. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-25249">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-25224">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-25250">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late <span class="marked id-unique-25266">evening</span>, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25228">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-25265">expect</span> there
will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-25262">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25211">deceased</span>." The <span class="marked id-unique-25237">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left <span class="marked id-unique-25230">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-25239">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-25195">Sherbrooke</span>.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the <span class="marked id-unique-25260">intense</span> heat
as the <span class="marked id-unique-25164">towering</span> flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-25256">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows <span class="marked id-unique-25165">three</span> of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
<span class="marked id-unique-25247">first</span> explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-25261">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other <span class="marked id-unique-25258">patrons</span> could do to
help those who hadn't <span class="marked id-unique-25263">fled</span> with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many <span class="marked id-unique-25257">popular</span> bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-25244">blast</span> was so <span class="marked id-unique-25260">intense</span> that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-25193">two</span> kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-25233">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-25214">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-25243">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-25210">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-25206">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-25215">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25185">cause</span> of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-25200">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25175">operator</span>,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-25229">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25267">Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25190">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-25203">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-25231">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-25192">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-25208">finished</span>
his run. Somehow it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-25191">without</span> a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25221">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-25267">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-25252">We've</span> had a very
<span class="marked id-unique-25180">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-25172">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-25251">years</span>," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-25252">we've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25188">blown</span> it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-25246">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-25223">800</span> kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-25196">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-25236">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25241">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-25253">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are <span class="marked id-unique-25170">security</span> mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-25238">everything</span> by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-25242">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-25225">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire <span class="marked id-unique-25184">department</span>, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-25218">Billowing</span> smoke <span class="marked id-unique-25212">continued</span> to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-25256">sky</span> Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a <span class="marked id-unique-25259">lot</span> of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who <span class="marked id-unique-25178">lives</span> about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-25254">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-25240">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25205">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25216">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-25248">Demers</span>, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-25261">home</span>.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-25226">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-25219">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25217">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-25207">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-25222">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-25266">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-25259">lot</span> of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-25213">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25194">terrible</span> for the <span class="marked id-unique-25174">population</span>."
<span class="marked id-unique-25248">Demers</span>, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 <span class="marked id-unique-25251">years</span>,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them <span class="marked id-unique-25181">getting</span> in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
<span class="marked id-unique-25168">spokeswoman</span> Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as <span class="marked id-unique-25177">long</span> as the authorities <span class="marked id-unique-25163">want</span> us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-25255">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the <span class="marked id-unique-25186">Calgary</span> Stampede, <span class="marked id-unique-25182">expressed</span> his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-25232">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-25235">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-25234">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-25245">added</span>: “We hope
<span class="marked id-unique-25209">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25198">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25197">safely</span> and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-25166">surrounding</span> areas can <span class="marked id-unique-25171">rest</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25189">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-25179">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-25176">monitoring</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-25169">situation</span> and
we <span class="marked id-unique-25167">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25173">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25202">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25220">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25199">requested</span> by
the <span class="marked id-unique-25201">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a <span class="marked id-unique-25257">popular</span> local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I <span class="marked id-unique-25183">don't</span> smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-25212">continued</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25215">burning</span> late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-25249">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the <span class="marked id-unique-25260">intense</span> heat of <span class="marked id-unique-25164">towering</span>
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night <span class="marked id-unique-25256">sky</span>,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-25218">billowing</span> black smoke could
still be seen <span class="marked id-unique-25177">long</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-25231">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-25227">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-25239">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25205">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25216">Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-25240">died</span>. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-25204">others</span>
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-25228">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-25183">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25163">want</span> to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-25265">expect</span> we'll have other people who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-25262">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25211">deceased</span> unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty <span class="marked id-unique-25181">getting</span> a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-25193">two</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25165">three</span> times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-25257">popular</span> area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the <span class="marked id-unique-25247">first</span> explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The <span class="marked id-unique-25185">cause</span> of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-25200">railway's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25175">operator</span> said.

The president and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-25190">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-25203">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-25192">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-25221">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-25229">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25267">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-25267">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-25208">finished</span> his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-25252">We've</span> had a very <span class="marked id-unique-25180">good</span> safety <span class="marked id-unique-25172">record</span> for these 10 <span class="marked id-unique-25251">years</span>,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-25252">we've</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25188">blown</span> it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-25243">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

<span class="marked id-unique-25258">Patrons</span> gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their <span class="marked id-unique-25178">lives</span> after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-25226">morning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25256">sky</span>.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the <span class="marked id-unique-25257">popular</span> Musi-Cafe when the <span class="marked id-unique-25247">first</span> explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-25225">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree <span class="marked id-unique-25187">burns</span>
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-25242">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-25230">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide <span class="marked id-unique-25170">security</span> perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful <span class="marked id-unique-25266">evening</span> like this with the bar, there
were a <span class="marked id-unique-25259">lot</span> of people there," said Bernard <span class="marked id-unique-25248">Demers</span>, who
owns a restaurant near the <span class="marked id-unique-25244">blast</span> site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-25213">catastrophe</span>. It's <span class="marked id-unique-25194">terrible</span> for the
<span class="marked id-unique-25174">population</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-25248">Demers</span>, who <span class="marked id-unique-25263">fled</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-25261">home</span>, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-25219">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25217">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-25207">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-25222">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife <span class="marked id-unique-25264">felt</span> the heat as they
sprinted from their <span class="marked id-unique-25261">home</span> after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-25237">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-25206">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-25210">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-25238">everything</span> that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-25233">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-25245">added</span> that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the <span class="marked id-unique-25250">air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-25195">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-25255">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-25182">expressed</span> his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-25234">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-25232">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-25235">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-25224">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope <span class="marked id-unique-25209">evacuees</span> can <span class="marked id-unique-25198">return</span> to their homes <span class="marked id-unique-25197">safely</span> and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and <span class="marked id-unique-25166">surrounding</span> areas
can <span class="marked id-unique-25171">rest</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25189">assured</span> that our <span class="marked id-unique-25179">government</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-25176">monitoring</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-25169">situation</span> and we <span class="marked id-unique-25167">stand</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-25173">ready</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-25202">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-25220">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-25199">requested</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-25201">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (<span class="marked id-unique-25223">800</span>
kilometers) of track <span class="marked id-unique-25196">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-25253">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-25236">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-25241">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in <span class="marked id-unique-25186">Calgary</span>, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-25191">without</span> spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-25246">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-25214">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine <span class="marked id-unique-25184">Department</span> of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-25254">trains</span>
travel, <span class="marked id-unique-25168">spokeswoman</span> Samantha Warren said recently.
