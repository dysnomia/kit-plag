<span class="marked id-unique-3529">Canada: Train</span> explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-3530">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-3531">Canadian town</span> was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-3535">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-3537">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 <span class="marked id-unique-3539">people were missing</span>, feared <span class="marked id-unique-3541">dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-3533">runaway</span> train</span> with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-3530">Lac-Megantic
in Quebec</span> before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-3544">crowded at the
time</span>. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3545">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-3546">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-3548">155 <span class="marked id-unique-3549">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3550">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire <span class="marked id-unique-3553">officials said</span> they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-3547">exclusion zone</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-3554">120
firefighters</span> battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-3532">forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-3555">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3545">000</span> people</span>.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-3557">amid fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-3558">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-3560">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-3543">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-3562">see the <span class="marked id-unique-3536">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-3563">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3564">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3565">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3566">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3528">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-3567">asking</span> ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-3568">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3569">get</span> through this event</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-3570">Police spokesman</span> Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-3571">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3572">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3551">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-3573">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-3559">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-3538">miles of track</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-3574">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-3542">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-3575">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-3552">overnight driver</span> shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-3577">parked the train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-3536">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-3556">train's <span class="marked id-unique-3540">cargo</span> spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-3581">Chaudiere
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-3580">communities <span class="marked id-unique-3576">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-3584">using <span class="marked id-unique-3585">river</span> water</span>.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-3586">smoke in the air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-3578">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-3579">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-3587">quality</span> of
the air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-3581">Chaudiere River</span>."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. <span class="marked id-unique-3553">Officials
said</span> they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-3574">Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-3588">Vermont</span>. Quebec</span> is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-3558">Police have said</span> they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-3541">dead

in the <span class="marked id-unique-3531">Canadian town</span> of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black <span class="marked id-unique-3586">smoke into the air</span>,
killing one and <span class="marked id-unique-3532">forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-3555">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3545">000</span> people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-3548">155 <span class="marked id-unique-3549">miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-3550">east</span> of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-3553">officials said</span> the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-3539">people missing</span>.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said <span class="marked id-unique-3570">police spokesman</span> Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-3554">120 firefighters</span> have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-3544">crowded at the time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-3559">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-3537">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-3552">overnight driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-3577">parked the train</span> and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-3551">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre <span class="marked id-unique-3547">exclusion zone</span> was set up <span class="marked id-unique-3557">amid fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-3562">see the <span class="marked id-unique-3536">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-3563">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3564">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3565">destroyed</span>,

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-3589">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-3590">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3593">000 people</span> live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-3594">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents <span class="marked id-unique-3595">reported hearing</span> as many as six

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely

<span class="marked id-unique-3604">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3605">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3596">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-3600">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-3609">Chaudiere

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying <span class="marked id-unique-3590">crude
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-3598">evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3593">000</span> people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-3599">police said</span> Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-3597">hours before the derailment</span>.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-3600">Montreal Maine</span> & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of <span class="marked id-unique-3600">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-3603">train got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-3600">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-3599">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-3606">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-3610">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-3591">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3607">New</span> Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-3608">described the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-3595">reported hearing</span>
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-3593">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-3590">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-3609">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-3601">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-3592">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3602">Roy-Laroche</span> said</span> trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-3613">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-3616">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-3618">crude <span class="marked id-unique-3619">oil</span> derailed</span> at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-3614">runaway train</span> with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-3613">Lac-Megantic
in Quebec</span> before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-3623">Witnesses said</span> the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3627">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-3628">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-3629">border with Maine</span> and about <span class="marked id-unique-3630">155 miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3631">east
of Montreal</span>.

About <span class="marked id-unique-3632">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-3624">several hours</span>
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-3627">000 people</span>.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-3640">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-3642">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-3626">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your <span class="marked id-unique-3645">town <span class="marked id-unique-3646">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3647">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3648">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3611">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-3649">asking</span> ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-3650">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3651">get</span> through this event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-3653">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-3655">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3656">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3636">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-3657">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-3641">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-3658">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-3625">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-3659">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-3660">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-3665">resident <span class="marked id-unique-3638">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3635">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3666">described</span> the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-3662">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-3634">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3639">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3667">everything</span> that was
there is gone</span>."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-3668">Bernard Demers</span>, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-3669">like an <span class="marked id-unique-3637">atomic</span> bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-3670">hot. <span class="marked id-unique-3622">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-3643">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-3671">Chaudiere</span>
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-3672">Environment <span class="marked id-unique-3673">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3644">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3615">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3674">Blanchette</span> said</span>
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-3661">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-3664">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-3676">quality</span> of
the air</span>.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-3677">spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-3617">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-3620">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-3633">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3678">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-3621">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-3679">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3680">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3681">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-3675">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-3652">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-3663">water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-3671">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-3682">Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-3683">rescue</span> workers</span> had to be called in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-3684">municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-3612">including</span> Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-3685">help <span class="marked id-unique-3654">deal</span> with the disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-3629">border with <span class="marked id-unique-3658">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3686">Vermont</span>. Quebec</span> is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

<span class="marked id-unique-3613">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec</span> (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a <span class="marked id-unique-3614">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-3616">train</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3618">crude <span class="marked id-unique-3619">oil</span> derailed</span> in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-3640">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
<span class="marked id-unique-3623">witnesses said</span>. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-3660">train derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-3627">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-3628">lakeside town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3627">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-3630">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-3631">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-3653">Michel Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-3640">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-3640">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-3645">town <span class="marked id-unique-3646">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3647">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-3648">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3611">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-3649">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-3650">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3651">get</span> through this event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-3642">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-3626">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-3614">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-3641">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of <span class="marked id-unique-3624">several hours</span> as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-3632">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-3623">Witnesses said</span> the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-3666">described the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said <span class="marked id-unique-3668">Bernard Demers</span>, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-3669">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-3637">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-3670">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-3622">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-3665">resident <span class="marked id-unique-3638">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3635">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3666">described</span> the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-3662">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-3634">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3639">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3667">everything</span> that was there is
gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-3672">Environment <span class="marked id-unique-3673">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3644">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3615">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3674">Blanchette</span> said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-3643">spilled
into the Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-3674">Blanchette said</span> the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-3618">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-3677">spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-3617">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-3620">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-3633">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3678">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-3621">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-3679">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3680">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3681">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-3675">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-3652">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-3663">water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-3671">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-3661">mobile laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-3664">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-3676">quality</span> of the air</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-3682">Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-3683">rescue</span> workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-3684">municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-3612">including</span> Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to <span class="marked id-unique-3685">help <span class="marked id-unique-3654">deal</span> with
the disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-3655">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3656">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3636">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-3657">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in <span class="marked id-unique-3613">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-3641">Montreal Maine</span> & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-3658">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-3686">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3625">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-3659">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-3616">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-3629">border. In Maine</span>, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-3618">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-3641">Montreal, Maine</span> and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-3688">freight train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-3689">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,

At least <span class="marked id-unique-3687">60 people</span> were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3690">000 people</span> live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 <span class="marked id-unique-3691">miles <span class="marked id-unique-3692">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-3696">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3697">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3693">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-3698">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-3694">Joseph McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the <span class="marked id-unique-3695">train got</span> released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-3688">freight train</span> pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-3689">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 <span class="marked id-unique-3691">miles <span class="marked id-unique-3692">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-3694">Joseph R. McGonigle</span> confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-3689">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the <span class="marked id-unique-3695">train got</span> loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-3690">000 people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
<span class="marked id-unique-3687">60 people</span> have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one person has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-3696">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-3697">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3693">Stephen</span> Harper</span>
has issued a statement:

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-3698">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and

derailment. We hope evacuees can return to their homes

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-4137">driverless <span class="marked id-unique-4138">freight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4139">train</span> carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-4141">crude oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4142">derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-4143">high</span> speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 <span class="marked id-unique-4145">people were missing</span>, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-4146">subsequent explosions</span> combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-4150">billowing smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-4148">Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-4152">said</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4153">town</span> centre</span> was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4154">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-4155">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-4156">30 buildings</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-4153">town centre</span> were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-4154">000 people</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-4161">Worried residents</span> looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-4162">friends and
<span class="marked id-unique-4163">loved</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4164">ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4165">may</span> have died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-4166">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-4169">last night</span>.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-4140">centre of your town</span> almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-4174">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been <span class="marked id-unique-4175">told about people</span>
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-4176">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4177">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4157">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-4178">Thoughts & <span class="marked id-unique-4179">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-4160">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4173">Horrible news</span>."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-4167">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-4180">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-4149">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-4181">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-4168">Joseph McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-4182">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-4144">sure what <span class="marked id-unique-4170">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-4151">engineer</span> did
<span class="marked id-unique-4183">everything</span> by the book</span>," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-4184">parked the <span class="marked id-unique-4185">train</span> and was <span class="marked id-unique-4186">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-4187">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4188">Somehow</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4172">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4189">got</span> released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-4140">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-4190">Bernard Demers</span>, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, <span class="marked id-unique-4159">said one</span> of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-4191">like an <span class="marked id-unique-4158">atomic</span> bomb</span> detonating.

He <span class="marked id-unique-4171">said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-4192">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4147">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-4180">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-4137">driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-4138">freight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4139">train</span> carrying</span> oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-4142">derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-4143">high</span> speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-4137">driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-4138">freight</span> train</span>, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-4141">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-4155">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-4146">subsequent explosions</span> that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-4156">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4154">000 people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-4148">Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-4152">said</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-4153">town</span> centre</span>, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-4167">Montreal,
Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving <span class="marked id-unique-4149">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-4181">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4180">Maine and Vermont</span>.
<span class="marked id-unique-4168">Joseph McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-4172">train got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-4140">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he <span class="marked id-unique-4159">said, should have been the only one</span> who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-4144">sure what <span class="marked id-unique-4170">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-4151">engineer</span> did <span class="marked id-unique-4183">everything</span> by the book</span>. He had <span class="marked id-unique-4184">parked
the <span class="marked id-unique-4185">train</span> and was <span class="marked id-unique-4186">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-4187">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-4188">somehow</span>,
the <span class="marked id-unique-4172">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4189">got</span> released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial <span class="marked id-unique-4166">police said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the <span class="marked id-unique-4182">train
derailed</span> in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-4169">last night</span> that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-4150">Billowing smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-4161">Worried
residents</span> watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-4162">friends
and <span class="marked id-unique-4163">loved</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4164">ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4165">may</span> have died</span>.  "We're <span class="marked id-unique-4175">told some <span class="marked id-unique-4145">people</span> are
missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4174">Michel Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
<span class="marked id-unique-4190">Bernard Demers</span>, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion <span class="marked id-unique-4191">like an <span class="marked id-unique-4158">atomic</span> bomb</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-4171">said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-4192">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-4147">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down <span class="marked id-unique-4163">loved ones</span>
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with <span class="marked id-unique-4163">loved ones</span>," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-4176">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4177">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4157">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-4178">Thoughts & <span class="marked id-unique-4179">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-4160">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic</span>,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-4173">Horrible news</span>.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-4176">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-4195">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-4198">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-4200">crude <span class="marked id-unique-4201">oil</span> derailed</span> at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-4196">runaway train</span> with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-4195">Lac-Megantic
in Quebec</span> before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-4205">Witnesses said</span> the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4209">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-4210">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-4211">border with Maine</span> and about <span class="marked id-unique-4212">155 miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4213">east
of Montreal</span>.

About <span class="marked id-unique-4214">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-4206">several hours</span>
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-4209">000 people</span>.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-4222">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-4224">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-4208">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your <span class="marked id-unique-4227">town <span class="marked id-unique-4228">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4229">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4230">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4193">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-4231">asking</span> ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-4232">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4233">get</span> through this event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-4235">Michel Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-4237">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4238">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4218">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-4239">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-4223">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-4240">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-4207">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-4241">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-4242">train derailed</span>.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-4247">resident <span class="marked id-unique-4220">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4217">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4248">described</span> the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-4244">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-4216">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4221">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4249">everything</span> that was
there is gone</span>."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-4250">Bernard Demers</span>, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-4251">like an <span class="marked id-unique-4219">atomic</span> bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-4252">hot. <span class="marked id-unique-4204">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-4225">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-4253">Chaudiere</span>
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-4254">Environment <span class="marked id-unique-4255">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4226">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4197">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4256">Blanchette</span> said</span>
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-4243">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-4246">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-4258">quality</span> of
the air</span>.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-4259">spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-4199">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-4202">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-4215">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4260">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-4203">advised</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-4261">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4262">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4263">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-4257">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-4234">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-4245">water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-4253">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-4264">Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-4265">rescue</span> workers</span> had to be called in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-4266">municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-4194">including</span> Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-4267">help <span class="marked id-unique-4236">deal</span> with the disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-4211">border with <span class="marked id-unique-4240">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-4268">Vermont</span>. Quebec</span> is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

          <div class="ref"><p class="info-text">Reference (train-ap-org):</p><pre>
<span class="marked id-unique-4195">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec</span> (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a <span class="marked id-unique-4196">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-4198">train</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4200">crude <span class="marked id-unique-4201">oil</span> derailed</span> in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-4222">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
<span class="marked id-unique-4205">witnesses said</span>. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-4242">train derailed</span>, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-4209">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-4210">lakeside town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-4209">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-4212">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-4213">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-4235">Michel Brunet</span> confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-4222">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-4222">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-4227">town <span class="marked id-unique-4228">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4229">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-4230">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4193">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-4231">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-4232">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4233">get</span> through this event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-4224">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-4208">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-4196">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-4223">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of <span class="marked id-unique-4206">several hours</span> as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-4214">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

<span class="marked id-unique-4205">Witnesses said</span> the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-4248">described the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said <span class="marked id-unique-4250">Bernard Demers</span>, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "<span class="marked id-unique-4251">like
an <span class="marked id-unique-4219">atomic</span> bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-4252">hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-4204">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-4247">resident <span class="marked id-unique-4220">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4217">Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4248">described</span> the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-4244">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-4216">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4221">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4249">everything</span> that was there is
gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-4254">Environment <span class="marked id-unique-4255">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4226">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4197">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4256">Blanchette</span> said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-4225">spilled
into the Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-4256">Blanchette said</span> the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-4200">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-4259">spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-4199">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-4202">river</span> that is

the <span class="marked id-unique-4253">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-4243">mobile laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-4246">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-4258">quality</span> of the air</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-4264">Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-4265">rescue</span> workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-4266">municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-4194">including</span> Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to <span class="marked id-unique-4267">help <span class="marked id-unique-4236">deal</span> with
the disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-4237">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-4238">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4218">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-4239">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in <span class="marked id-unique-4195">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-4223">Montreal Maine</span> & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-4240">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-4268">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4207">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-4241">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-4198">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-4211">border. In Maine</span>, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-4200">crude oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-4223">Montreal, Maine</span> and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

<span class="marked id-unique-9376">Canada: Train</span> explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9379">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-9375">runaway train</span> with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-9383">crowded at the
time</span>. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-9382">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 <span class="marked id-unique-9381">miles <span class="marked id-unique-9384">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as <span class="marked id-unique-9385">120
firefighters</span> battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-9386">forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-9387">evacuation</span> of 1,000</span> people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-9388">amid fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-9389">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-9391">see the <span class="marked id-unique-9378">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-9392">town</span> almost</span>
destroyed, you'll understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-9393">asking ourselves
how we are going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and

<span class="marked id-unique-9394">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9395">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9390">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-9380">miles of track</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-9396">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-9398">overnight driver</span> shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-9400">parked the train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-9378">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-9402">Chaudiere
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-9403">Environment Quebec</span> spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-9377">Christian Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-9404">communities <span class="marked id-unique-9399">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-9405">using river</span> water.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-9406">smoke in the air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-9407">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-9401">monitor the quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-9402">Chaudiere River</span>."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. <span class="marked id-unique-9397">Officials
said</span> they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-9396">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-9389">Police have said</span> they expect more people to be found dead
after a <span class="marked id-unique-9375">runaway train</span> carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-9379">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black <span class="marked id-unique-9406">smoke into the air</span>,
killing one and <span class="marked id-unique-9386">forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-9387">evacuation</span> of 1,000</span> people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 <span class="marked id-unique-9381">miles) <span class="marked id-unique-9384">east</span> of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-9397">officials said</span> the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-9385">120 firefighters</span> have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-9383">crowded at the time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-9398">overnight driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-9400">parked the train</span> and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-9390">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up <span class="marked id-unique-9388">amid fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-9391">see the <span class="marked id-unique-9378">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-9392">town</span> almost</span> destroyed,
you'll understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-9393">asking ourselves how we

Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-9394">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9395">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
<span class="marked id-unique-9402">Chaudiere river</span>, said <span class="marked id-unique-9403">Environment Quebec</span> spokesman

A <span class="marked id-unique-9407">mobile laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-9401">monitor the quality</span>

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9408">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents <span class="marked id-unique-9409">reported hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a

<span class="marked id-unique-9416">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9417">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9415">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying <span class="marked id-unique-9408">crude
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-9411">evacuation of up
to 1,000</span> people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-9412">police said</span> Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-9410">hours before the derailment</span>.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-9412">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-9418">Maine, Vermont</span>,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-9419">described the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-9409">reported hearing</span>
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-9408">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-9420">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-9413">Mayor Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9414">Roy-Laroche said</span> trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

<span class="marked id-unique-9423">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec</span> (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a <span class="marked id-unique-9421">runaway train</span> carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-9434">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-9426">lakeside town</span> of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-9429">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-9428">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-9434">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-9434">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-9437">town almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9438">destroyed,
you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9439">understand that we're asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-9440">going to <span class="marked id-unique-9441">get</span> through this event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-9435">Mayor
Colette</span> Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-9421">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-9450">described the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-9432">atomic bomb</span>. It was very hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-9427">Everybody was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident <span class="marked id-unique-9449">Claude <span class="marked id-unique-9431">Bedard</span> described</span> the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro <span class="marked id-unique-9430">store, <span class="marked id-unique-9433">Dollarama</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-9451">everything</span> that was there is
gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-9453">Environment Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9436">spokesman Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9454">Blanchette said</span>
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-9454">Blanchette said</span> the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-9424">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-9425">concerning <span class="marked id-unique-9457">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-9446">advised</span> the local</span> municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-9455">careful if they take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-9447">water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-9452">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-9456">mobile laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-9448">monitor the quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-9422">including Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to <span class="marked id-unique-9458">help <span class="marked id-unique-9442">deal</span> with
the disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-9443">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in <span class="marked id-unique-9423">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-9444">Maine, Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-9445">New Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-9424">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-9460">freight train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9461">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-9459">60 people</span> were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-9462">east
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-9464">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9465">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9463">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-9460">freight train</span> pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-9461">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-9462">east
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-9461">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
<span class="marked id-unique-9459">60 people</span> have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one person has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-9464">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9465">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9463">Stephen</span> Harper</span>
has issued a statement:

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment. We hope evacuees can return to their homes
safely and quickly."

<span class="marked id-unique-9730">exploded</span>. In just</span> one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-9499">centre of the town</span> was

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-9736">terrible</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-9737">said</span>. "<span class="marked id-unique-9738">We've</span> never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9739">seen <span class="marked id-unique-9681">anything</span>

sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-9573">atomic <span class="marked id-unique-9746">bomb</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9747">detonating</span>.

He <span class="marked id-unique-9631">said</span>: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-9748">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-9525">Everybody</span> was afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-9749">train's <span class="marked id-unique-9750">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9620">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-9751">Chaudiere</span>

of <span class="marked id-unique-9758">using</span> river</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9469">water.

He said</span>: "<span class="marked id-unique-9630">Right <span class="marked id-unique-9760">now</span> there is <span class="marked id-unique-9558">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9761">smoke</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-9686">air</span>, so we

the <span class="marked id-unique-9765">air</span>.

"We also have a spill</span> on the lake and the <span class="marked id-unique-9712">river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-9517">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9766">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-9693">advised</span> the local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9767">municipalities

<span class="marked id-unique-9768">Firefighters</span> and rescue</span> workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-9769">called in from

THE centre</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-9486">picturesque Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9493">town was <span class="marked id-unique-9467">wiped</span>
out <span class="marked id-unique-9475">yesterday</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-9487">driverless</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9497">freight</span> train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9480">carrying
hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-9488">tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9500">crude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9502">oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9505">derailed</span> at high</span> speed,
<span class="marked id-unique-9501">sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-9491">series</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-9506">explosions</span>.

At <span class="marked id-unique-9508">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9495">60</span> people</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-9471">missing, <span class="marked id-unique-9509">feared</span> dead</span>, after the

in <span class="marked id-unique-9522">Quebec</span> before <span class="marked id-unique-9484">coming</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-9523">rails</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9477">shortly</span> after <span class="marked id-unique-9528">1am</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-9529">5am</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9521">UK</span> time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-9530">Four of the <span class="marked id-unique-9485">pressurised-tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9498">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9494">caught</span> fire</span>. The
<span class="marked id-unique-9511">subsequent explosions</span> combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-9527">fireball,
with flames</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9532">shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-9489">sky</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-9536">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9470">smoke</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9492">visible</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-9538">several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9539">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9541">away</span>.

Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9543">said the town</span> centre was <span class="marked id-unique-9544">crowded at the
time</span>. About 6,000 <span class="marked id-unique-9545">people <span class="marked id-unique-9547">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-9524">lakeside</span> town</span>, which

About <span class="marked id-unique-9468">30 <span class="marked id-unique-9515">buildings</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-9512">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9534">centre</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-9551">destroyed</span> in
the <span class="marked id-unique-9552">inferno</span>. Residents</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9518">reported hearing</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-9554">many as <span class="marked id-unique-9555">six</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9557">loud</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9559">blasts</span> soon</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-9560">derailment.

rising</span> from the <span class="marked id-unique-9569">centre of <span class="marked id-unique-9496">Lac-Megantic</span> several</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9570">hours
after the disaster</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-9571">Fire officials</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9572">said they <span class="marked id-unique-9574">feared</span> more of the <span class="marked id-unique-9575">tanker</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-9576">carriages</span> could <span class="marked id-unique-9577">explode</span>. One</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9578">carriage <span class="marked id-unique-9580">remained</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-9533">fire</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-9586">Authorities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9587">set</span> up a half-mile</span> exclusion zone as <span class="marked id-unique-9588">120

<span class="marked id-unique-9591">evacuation</span> of 1,000</span> people.

Worried <span class="marked id-unique-9592">residents <span class="marked id-unique-9593">looked</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-9595">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9597">fears</span> that friends</span> and

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-9783">driverless <span class="marked id-unique-9784">freight</span> train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9786">crude oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9787">derailed at high</span> speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-9790">billowing smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-9792">said the town</span> centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-9788">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-9782">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
<span class="marked id-unique-9794">loved <span class="marked id-unique-9795">ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9796">may</span> have died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-9785">centre of your town</span> almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-9798">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9799">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & <span class="marked id-unique-9800">prayers are
with those impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic. <span class="marked id-unique-9801">Horrible news</span>."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-9802">New
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-9803">Joseph McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-9804">sure what happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-9791">engineer did
<span class="marked id-unique-9805">everything</span> by the book</span>," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-9806">parked the train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-9807">Somehow the train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9808">got released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-9785">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-9793">atomic bomb</span> detonating.

He <span class="marked id-unique-9797">said: "It was very hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-9789">Everybody was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-9783">driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-9784">freight</span> train</span> carrying oil tankers <span class="marked id-unique-9787">derailed at high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-9783">driverless
<span class="marked id-unique-9784">freight</span> train</span>, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-9786">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-9788">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-9782">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-9792">said
the town</span> centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-9802">New Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-9803">Joseph McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-9785">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-9804">sure what happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-9791">engineer did <span class="marked id-unique-9805">everything</span> by the book</span>. He had <span class="marked id-unique-9806">parked
the train</span> and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-9807">somehow,
the train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9808">got released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-9790">Billowing smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and <span class="marked id-unique-9794">loved <span class="marked id-unique-9795">ones</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9796">may</span> have died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-9793">atomic bomb</span>," he <span class="marked id-unique-9797">said. "It
was very hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-9789">Everybody was afraid</span>." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down <span class="marked id-unique-9794">loved ones</span>
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-9798">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9799">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & <span class="marked id-unique-9800">prayers are with those impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-9801">Horrible news</span>.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-9798">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-9812">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-9813">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the

<span class="marked id-unique-9831">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9832">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-9833">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-9834">New
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident <span class="marked id-unique-9839">Claude Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9840">described the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-9836">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-9818">store</span>, Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-9819">atomic bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. <span class="marked id-unique-9816">Everybody was afraid</span>."

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-9822">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-9841">Chaudiere</span>
River</span>.

Environment Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-9823">spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-9811">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9842">Blanchette</span> said</span>
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-9844">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-9838">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-9845">quality</span> of
the air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-9814">concerning <span class="marked id-unique-9846">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-9835">advised</span> the local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9847">municipalities
downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-9843">careful if they take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-9837">water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-9841">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-9848">Firefighters and rescue</span> workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-9849">help deal</span> with the disaster. Officials

United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-9833">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-9812">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec</span> (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a <span class="marked id-unique-9809">runaway train</span> carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-9813">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-9820">Police said</span> they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-9815">lakeside town</span> of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-9817">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-9820">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-9820">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-9824">town almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9825">destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-9826">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9827">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-9828">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-9829">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-9830">get</span> through this event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-9821">Mayor
Colette</span> Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-9810">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-9840">described the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-9819">atomic bomb</span>. It was very hot. ... <span class="marked id-unique-9816">Everybody was afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident <span class="marked id-unique-9839">Claude Bedard</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9840">described the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-9836">Metro <span class="marked id-unique-9818">store</span>, Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-9823">spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-9811">Christian</span> Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-9822">spilled
into the Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-9842">Blanchette said</span> the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-9814">concerning <span class="marked id-unique-9846">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-9835">advised</span> the local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-9847">municipalities
downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-9843">careful if they take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-9837">water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-9841">Chaudiere</span> River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-9844">mobile laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-9838">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-9845">quality</span> of the air</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-9848">Firefighters and rescue</span> workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to <span class="marked id-unique-9849">help deal</span> with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-9831">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-9832">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in <span class="marked id-unique-9812">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-9833">Maine, Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-9834">New Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-9813">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-14029">driverless</span> freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-14019">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-14066">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14055">dead</span>, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-14052">runaway</span> train with <span class="marked id-unique-14033">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-14040">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-14035">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-14017">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-14024">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-14039">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-14064">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-14034">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-14048">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-14066">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-14007">exclusion</span> zone as <span class="marked id-unique-14011">120</span>
firefighters battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-14006">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-14015">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-14010">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14014">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-14063">confirmed</span> late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-14038">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14041">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14037">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14051">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-14059">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-14018">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14032">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-14027">event</span>."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-14060">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14061">Minister</span> Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-14044">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-14042">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14045">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-14058">track</span> in Maine and
<span class="marked id-unique-14057">Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14046">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14049">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-14003">unknown</span> how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-14012">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14016">driver</span> shift <span class="marked id-unique-14009">change</span>.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-14047">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-14053">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-14020">Somehow</span> the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-14026">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train <span class="marked id-unique-14004">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the <span class="marked id-unique-14001">wagons</span> come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-14054">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-14065">Bernard</span> Demers, who had to evacuate his
<span class="marked id-unique-14062">home</span> after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-14031">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14036">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-14028">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14030">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14050">Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-14008">communities</span> downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-14002">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the <span class="marked id-unique-14056">air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-14023">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14025">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-14022">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14021">quality</span> of
the <span class="marked id-unique-14056">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-14043">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-14005">neighbouring</span> municipalities, including Sherbrooke and

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-14066">feared</span> in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-14055">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-14052">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-14056">air</span>,
killing one and <span class="marked id-unique-14006">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14015">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-14034">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-14048">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-14026">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a <span class="marked id-unique-14005">neighbouring</span> village before a scheduled crew <span class="marked id-unique-14009">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-14003">unknown</span> reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-14029">driverless</span> train
reached the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-14004">travelling</span> at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-14019">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-14063">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-14011">120</span> firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-14064">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-14017">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
<span class="marked id-unique-14065">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and <span class="marked id-unique-14066">feared</span> for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was <span class="marked id-unique-14024">live</span>."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-14054">described</span> how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-14001">wagons</span>.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-14033">73</span> cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-14040">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-14012">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14016">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-14053">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-14020">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-14047">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-14013">half</span> a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre <span class="marked id-unique-14007">exclusion</span> zone was set up <span class="marked id-unique-14010">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14014">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-14059">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-14018">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14032">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-14027">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-14038">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14041">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14037">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-14060">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14061">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-14044">statement</span>: "Our

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-14074">high</span> speed,
sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-14067">series</span> of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-14112">least</span> 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-14096">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-14084">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with <span class="marked id-unique-14114">flames</span> shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-14102">sky</span> and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-14116">smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-14098">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-14070">hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge <span class="marked id-unique-14110">clouds</span> of thick acrid <span class="marked id-unique-14116">smoke</span> could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-14108">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-14081">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
almost <span class="marked id-unique-14072">12</span> hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-14115">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-14076">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid <span class="marked id-unique-14075">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to <span class="marked id-unique-14069">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-14073">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-14090">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-14086">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14087">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14085">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-14079">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the <span class="marked id-unique-14071">firemen</span> haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-14103">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-14113">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-14104">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14106">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14101">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-14109">took</span> to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-14100">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14089">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14092">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-14111">McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-14091">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-14094">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-14080">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-14077">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-14093">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the <span class="marked id-unique-14118">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-14095">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-14099">train's</span> cargo <span class="marked id-unique-14083">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-14116">smoke</span> in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-14078">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the <span class="marked id-unique-14117">local</span> municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-14088">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-14082">called</span> in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-14107">help</span> deal with the <span class="marked id-unique-14108">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-14107">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
<span class="marked id-unique-14068">region</span>, an <span class="marked id-unique-14097">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14105">popular</span> with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
<span class="marked id-unique-14067">series</span> of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-14104">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14106">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14101">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-14103">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-14112">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-14093">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom <span class="marked id-unique-14110">clouds</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-14102">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-14116">Smoke</span> rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-14076">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would <span class="marked id-unique-14077">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-14096">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-14079">give</span> an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't <span class="marked id-unique-14069">reach</span> a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-14075">fears</span> that five of the tankers cars
might still <span class="marked id-unique-14081">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-14078">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  <span class="marked id-unique-14117">Local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14115">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
<span class="marked id-unique-14107">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the <span class="marked id-unique-14071">firemen</span> that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-14091">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-14082">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-14113">going</span> to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-14094">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-14090">late</span> Friday night. The two
town centres are about <span class="marked id-unique-14072">12</span> kilometres apart.  Joe <span class="marked id-unique-14111">McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the <span class="marked id-unique-14118">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-14099">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions <span class="marked id-unique-14109">took</span> place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14089">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14092">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-14118">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-14095">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-14098">Witnesses</span> reported <span class="marked id-unique-14070">hearing</span>
multiple explosions and seeing <span class="marked id-unique-14114">flames</span> shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-14074">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and <span class="marked id-unique-14110">clouds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14116">smoke</span> emanating from
the <span class="marked id-unique-14068">region</span>.  According to officials, the blasts <span class="marked id-unique-14109">took</span>
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-14105">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14097">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The <span class="marked id-unique-14108">disaster</span> forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-14084">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-14107">help</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14100">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-14073">phone</span>.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-14088">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-14108">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-14083">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-14206">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14189">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-14159">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-14163">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-14205">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-14167">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-14161">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-14125">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14180">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-14155">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
<span class="marked id-unique-14205">time</span>. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-14140">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-14166">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-14204">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-14160">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-14181">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-14185">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen <span class="marked id-unique-14194">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-14201">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-14206">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-14146">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-14190">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-14207">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-14184">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-14123">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-14176">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-14182">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-14202">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14179">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-14165">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14169">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14164">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-14145">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-14200">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14186">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-14196">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-14190">almost</span>
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-14131">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14157">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-14200">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-14147">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14138">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14153">Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely

with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-14193">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14177">New</span>

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-14132">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-14191">We've</span> never seen anything

there is <span class="marked id-unique-14124">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-14197">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-14156">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14154">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14144">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-14168">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-14158">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-14192">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14151">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14162">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-14203">Chaudiere</span>
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-14148">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14150">Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-14209">careful</span>
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-14170">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-14137">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14143">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-14136">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14134">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-14142">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-14128">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14208">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-14130">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-14178">municipalities</span>
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-14209">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-14173">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-14203">Chaudiere</span> River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-14122">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14119">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-14152">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-14178">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-14133">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-14127">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-14201">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-14204">border</span> with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-14135">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-14179">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-14155">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-14194">still</span> be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-14166">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-14160">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-14181">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-14204">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14138">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14153">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14202">confirmed</span> that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-14182">died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-14189">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-14207">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-14200">get</span> into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-14145">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-14176">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-14146">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-14163">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-14205">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-14196">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-14190">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-14131">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14157">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-14200">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-14147">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-14165">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14169">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14164">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-14201">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-14188">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-14191">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-14191">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-14185">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-14123">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-14125">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
<span class="marked id-unique-14205">time</span> of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-14206">feared</span> for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-14190">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-14140">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-14184">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-14206">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-14197">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-14170">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-14132">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-14156">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14154">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14144">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-14168">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-14158">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-14180">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-14121">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14129">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14171">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-14126">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-14139">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14120">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14149">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-14124">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-14148">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14150">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-14162">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-14203">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-14159">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-14167">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-14142">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-14128">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14208">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-14130">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-14178">municipalities</span>
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-14209">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-14173">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-14203">Chaudiere</span> River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14186">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-14137">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14143">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-14136">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14134">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-14122">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14119">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-14178">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-14133">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-14152">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-14127">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-14201">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-14198">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14199">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14195">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-14174">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-14172">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14175">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-14161">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-14187">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-14135">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-14193">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-14177">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14183">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-14151">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-14141">likely</span> to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-14204">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-14192">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-14223">freight</span> train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-14239">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14214">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-14224">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-14225">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-14234">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-14231">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-14219">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-14215">six</span>
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-14212">Huge</span> clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-14241">zone</span> as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-14213">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14232">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-14240">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14228">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-14237">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14238">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14236">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-14227">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-14226">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14229">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-14218">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-14217">overnight</span> driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-14230">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-14222">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14216">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14210">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14211">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-14221">left</span> a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-14233">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-14235">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-14220">half</span> of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-14219">Inferno</span> In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At <span class="marked id-unique-14239">least</span> one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-14223">freight</span> train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-14222">full</span> of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-14231">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war <span class="marked id-unique-14241">zone</span>.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not <span class="marked id-unique-14216">report</span> other <span class="marked id-unique-14211">injuries</span>.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a <span class="marked id-unique-14212">huge</span> ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-14218">Joseph</span> R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that <span class="marked id-unique-14224">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-14235">train's</span> conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor <span class="marked id-unique-14221">left</span>),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-14220">half</span> a
mile outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-14232">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-14234">witnesses</span> reported between <span class="marked id-unique-14225">four</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14215">six</span> explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-14217">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-14230">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not <span class="marked id-unique-14210">yet</span> known if
there are any <span class="marked id-unique-14213">casualties</span>, but according to Radio-Canada
<span class="marked id-unique-14214">60</span> people have been reported missing."

in Quebec before <span class="marked id-unique-14292">coming</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-14326">rails</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14431">shortly</span> after <span class="marked id-unique-14307">1am</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-14305">5am</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14247">UK</span> time).

<span class="marked id-unique-14437">Four</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-14267">pressurised-tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14384">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14295">caught</span> fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-14428">subsequent</span> explosions <span class="marked id-unique-14294">combined</span> into a <span class="marked id-unique-14373">giant</span> fireball,
with flames <span class="marked id-unique-14257">shooting</span> into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-14420">billowing</span> smoke
<span class="marked id-unique-14246">visible</span> from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-14380">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-14399">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-14435">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-14425">155</span> miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-14368">inferno</span>. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-14336">hearing</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-14358">six</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14278">loud</span> blasts <span class="marked id-unique-14256">soon</span> after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-14334">Huge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14382">clouds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14251">thick</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14303">acrid</span> smoke could be <span class="marked id-unique-14432">seen</span> still
<span class="marked id-unique-14263">rising</span> from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the <span class="marked id-unique-14427">tanker</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14384">carriages</span> could <span class="marked id-unique-14409">explode</span>. One <span class="marked id-unique-14296">carriage</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14264">remained</span> on fire
almost <span class="marked id-unique-14353">12</span> hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a <span class="marked id-unique-14282">half-mile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14339">exclusion</span> zone as <span class="marked id-unique-14352">120</span>
firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-14297">battled</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14341">control</span> the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-14337">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-14376">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-14354">Worried</span> residents <span class="marked id-unique-14366">looked</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-14348">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14374">fears</span> that friends and
<span class="marked id-unique-14398">loved</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-14397">may</span> have died in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-14316">unable</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-14325">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-14363">phone</span>, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-14344">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-14434">Mayor</span> Colette <span class="marked id-unique-14433">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many <span class="marked id-unique-14272">parents</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-14354">worried</span>
because they <span class="marked id-unique-14405">haven't</span> been <span class="marked id-unique-14350">able</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14291">communicate</span> with a <span class="marked id-unique-14276">member</span>
of their family or an <span class="marked id-unique-14304">acquaintance</span>.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-14345">can't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14406">give</span> out any <span class="marked id-unique-14279">information</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-14245">what's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14281">happening</span>
right now because the <span class="marked id-unique-14338">firemen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14405">haven't</span> been <span class="marked id-unique-14350">able</span> to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-14386">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14422">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-14410">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14395">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14418">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-14349">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14329">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-14311">victims</span>… we've been told about people
who are not <span class="marked id-unique-14302">answering</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-14270">phones</span>, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on <span class="marked id-unique-14280">holiday</span>."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-14356">took</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14317">Twitter</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14265">release</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-14332">initial</span> statement, <span class="marked id-unique-14269">posting</span>: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-14333">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic. <span class="marked id-unique-14335">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-14298">Atlantic - a</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14284">firm</span> that owns <span class="marked id-unique-14261">roughly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14306">510</span> miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the <span class="marked id-unique-14315">United</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14320">States</span>, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-14312">vice-president</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14277">marketing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14367">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
<span class="marked id-unique-14273">no-one</span> had been on <span class="marked id-unique-14347">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-14314">unknown</span> how the train <span class="marked id-unique-14287">ended</span> up out
of <span class="marked id-unique-14341">control</span>. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-14340">distance</span> from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-14364">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14377">driver</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14258">shift</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14343">change</span>.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-14319">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-14346">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-14309">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-14322">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-14389">Somehow</span> the train got <span class="marked id-unique-14323">released</span>.

"There <span class="marked id-unique-14300">appears</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-14285">extensive</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14289">damage</span> to buildings but
we <span class="marked id-unique-14405">haven't</span> got a <span class="marked id-unique-14407">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14362">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14308">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14331">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-14400">likely</span> are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-14375">Eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14242">Yvon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14262">Rosa</span> had just <span class="marked id-unique-14401">left</span> a bar when he <span class="marked id-unique-14359">saw</span> the
train <span class="marked id-unique-14252">speeding</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-14275">middle</span> of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-14365">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14432">seen</span> a train <span class="marked id-unique-14318">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-14359">saw</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14310">wagons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14293">come</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-14426">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one <span class="marked id-unique-14274">minute</span> the centre of the town was
<span class="marked id-unique-14290">covered</span> in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-14360">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14383">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-14378">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-14387">terrible</span>," he said. "We've <span class="marked id-unique-14365">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14432">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14301">anything</span>
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-14396">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14357">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14413">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-14372">gone</span>."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-14328">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to <span class="marked id-unique-14286">evacuate</span> his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-14255">sounded</span> like an <span class="marked id-unique-14421">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14419">bomb</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14288">detonating</span>.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14404">hot</span>. Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-14423">afraid</span>."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-14415">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14429">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-14411">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14414">Christian</span> Blanchette said
<span class="marked id-unique-14342">communities</span> downstream of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-14416">careful</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-14313">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-14394">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14403">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-14393">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14391">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-14430">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-14402">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-14381">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-14385">advised</span> the local municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-14416">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-14361">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14355">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-14417">called</span> in from
<span class="marked id-unique-14330">neighbouring</span> municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-14436">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14390">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-14260">Saint-Georges</span>, to help <span class="marked id-unique-14379">deal</span> with the disaster. Officials
said they had <span class="marked id-unique-14299">asked</span> for help from fire <span class="marked id-unique-14259">services</span> in the
<span class="marked id-unique-14315">United</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14320">States</span>.

Lac-Megantic is <span class="marked id-unique-14271">part</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14266">Quebec's</span> Eastern <span class="marked id-unique-14248">Townships</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14324">region</span>, an area popular with <span class="marked id-unique-14249">tourists</span> that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a <span class="marked id-unique-14268">predominantly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14283">French-speaking</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14392">province</span> in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-14371">half</span> of Canada.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-14327">picturesque</span> Canadian town was <span class="marked id-unique-14244">wiped</span>
out <span class="marked id-unique-14243">yesterday</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-14412">driverless</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14408">freight</span> train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-14369">hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14250">tonnes</span> of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-14370">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14388">speed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-14254">sparking</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-14321">series</span> of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-14351">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-14424">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14384">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14253">sped</span> into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before <span class="marked id-unique-14292">coming</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-14326">rails</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14431">shortly</span> after <span class="marked id-unique-14307">1am</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-14305">5am</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14247">UK</span> time).

<span class="marked id-unique-14437">Four</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-14267">pressurised-tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14384">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14295">caught</span> fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-14428">subsequent</span> explosions <span class="marked id-unique-14294">combined</span> into a <span class="marked id-unique-14373">giant</span> fireball,

<span class="marked id-unique-14246">visible</span> from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-14380">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-14399">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-14435">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-14425">155</span> miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-14368">inferno</span>. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-14336">hearing</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-14358">six</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14278">loud</span> blasts <span class="marked id-unique-14256">soon</span> after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-14334">Huge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14382">clouds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14251">thick</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14303">acrid</span> smoke could be <span class="marked id-unique-14432">seen</span> still
<span class="marked id-unique-14263">rising</span> from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the <span class="marked id-unique-14427">tanker</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14384">carriages</span> could <span class="marked id-unique-14409">explode</span>. One <span class="marked id-unique-14296">carriage</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14264">remained</span> on fire
almost <span class="marked id-unique-14353">12</span> hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a <span class="marked id-unique-14282">half-mile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14339">exclusion</span> zone as <span class="marked id-unique-14352">120</span>
firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-14297">battled</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-14341">control</span> the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-14337">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-14376">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-14354">Worried</span> residents <span class="marked id-unique-14366">looked</span> on <span class="marked id-unique-14348">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14374">fears</span> that friends and
<span class="marked id-unique-14398">loved</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-14397">may</span> have died in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-14316">unable</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-14325">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-14363">phone</span>, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-14344">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-14434">Mayor</span> Colette <span class="marked id-unique-14433">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many <span class="marked id-unique-14272">parents</span> are <span class="marked id-unique-14354">worried</span>

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-14386">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14422">asking</span> ourselves

<span class="marked id-unique-14375">Eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14242">Yvon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14262">Rosa</span> had just <span class="marked id-unique-14401">left</span> a bar when he <span class="marked id-unique-14359">saw</span> the
train <span class="marked id-unique-14252">speeding</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-14275">middle</span> of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-14365">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14432">seen</span> a train <span class="marked id-unique-14318">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-14359">saw</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14310">wagons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14293">come</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-14426">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one <span class="marked id-unique-14274">minute</span> the centre of the town was
<span class="marked id-unique-14290">covered</span> in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-14360">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14383">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-14378">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-14387">terrible</span>," he said. "We've <span class="marked id-unique-14365">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14432">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14301">anything</span>
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-14396">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14357">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14413">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-14372">gone</span>."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-14328">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to <span class="marked id-unique-14286">evacuate</span> his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-14255">sounded</span> like an <span class="marked id-unique-14421">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14419">bomb</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14288">detonating</span>.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14404">hot</span>. Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-14423">afraid</span>."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-14415">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14429">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-14411">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14414">Christian</span> Blanchette said
<span class="marked id-unique-14342">communities</span> downstream of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-14416">careful</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-14313">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-14394">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14403">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-14393">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14391">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-14430">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-14402">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-14381">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-14385">advised</span> the local municipalities
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-14416">careful</span> if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-14361">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14355">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-14417">called</span> in from
<span class="marked id-unique-14330">neighbouring</span> municipalities, <span class="marked id-unique-14436">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14390">Sherbrooke</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-14260">Saint-Georges</span>, to help <span class="marked id-unique-14379">deal</span> with the disaster. Officials
said they had <span class="marked id-unique-14299">asked</span> for help from fire <span class="marked id-unique-14259">services</span> in the
<span class="marked id-unique-14315">United</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14320">States</span>.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-14447">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14495">Canadian</span> town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-14516">driverless</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14515">freight</span> train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-14508">hundreds</span> of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-14463">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14512">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-14493">runaway</span> train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the <span class="marked id-unique-14446">rails</span> shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-14478">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-14486">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-14475">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-14497">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-14465">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-14479">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-14487">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 <span class="marked id-unique-14503">buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-14462">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-14458">six</span>
loud <span class="marked id-unique-14491">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-14511">zone</span> as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-14490">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-14505">Worried</span> residents looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-14502">friends</span> and
loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-14488">died</span> in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-14441">unable</span>
to reach family or <span class="marked id-unique-14502">friends</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-14460">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-14485">last</span> night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are <span class="marked id-unique-14505">worried</span>
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-14454">can't</span> give out any information on what's happening
<span class="marked id-unique-14494">right</span> now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14492">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-14510">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14469">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14473">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-14457">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14449">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-14439">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-14498">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14500">Stephen</span> Harper took to <span class="marked id-unique-14442">Twitter</span> to release
an <span class="marked id-unique-14450">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14482">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-14480">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14483">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-14451">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic. <span class="marked id-unique-14452">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14484">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14489">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-14440">vice-president</span> of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-14461">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on <span class="marked id-unique-14456">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-14453">distance</span> from the
town during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-14464">driver</span> shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-14443">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-14455">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-14438">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-14444">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-14513">Somehow</span> the train got <span class="marked id-unique-14445">released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to <span class="marked id-unique-14503">buildings</span> but
we haven't got a full <span class="marked id-unique-14459">report</span> yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-14509">Eyewitness</span> Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-14514">left</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-14504">bar</span> when he <span class="marked id-unique-14506">saw</span> the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-14507">never</span> seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-14506">saw</span> the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the <span class="marked id-unique-14517">scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-14466">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-14498">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14507">never</span> seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-14470">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-14472">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-14448">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-14476">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14474">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14471">hot</span>. Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-14477">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-14499">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-14494">Right</span> now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-14481">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-14467">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-14501">help</span> deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-14501">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an <span class="marked id-unique-14496">area</span> popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-14468">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-14516">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14515">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-14463">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14512">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-14516">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14515">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-14506">saw</span> and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-14447">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14479">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-14494">right</span> arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-14478">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames <span class="marked id-unique-14508">hundreds</span> of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-14486">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 <span class="marked id-unique-14503">buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-14514">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-14487">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-14467">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-14508">Hundreds</span> of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-14462">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass <span class="marked id-unique-14494">right</span> through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
<span class="marked id-unique-14509">eyewitness</span> accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, <span class="marked id-unique-14448">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-14441">unable</span> to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-14514">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe <span class="marked id-unique-14453">distance</span> away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-14449">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-14501">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-14497">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-14465">crowded</span> when the train flew off the <span class="marked id-unique-14446">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-14450">initial</span> blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-14481">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the <span class="marked id-unique-14503">buildings</span>
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-14491">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-14472">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-14470">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-14493">runaway</span>.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-14513">Somehow</span> it headed into town without a <span class="marked id-unique-14464">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-14510">going</span>
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-14498">We've</span> had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-14498">we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-14511">zone</span>: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-14484">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14489">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-14461">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-14440">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-14443">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-14455">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-14438">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-14444">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-14513">somehow</span>,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-14445">released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety <span class="marked id-unique-14456">Board</span> of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-14512">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting <span class="marked id-unique-14509">eyewitness</span> accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-14459">report</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-14490">blaze</span> had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-14485">last</span> night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-14475">Billowing</span> smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-14507">never</span> allow <span class="marked id-unique-14499">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes <span class="marked id-unique-14457">absolutely</span>
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-14505">Worried</span>
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-14502">friends</span>
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-14488">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14469">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14473">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-14454">can't</span> tell you at the moment
whether there are any <span class="marked id-unique-14439">victims</span> or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-14476">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14474">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-14471">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-14477">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-14496">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-14504">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-14466">terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-14501">help</span> people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-14460">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping

spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the <span class="marked id-unique-14517">scene</span> and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-14500">Stephen</span> Harper, who

on <span class="marked id-unique-14442">Twitter</span>.  “<span class="marked id-unique-14480">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14483">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-14451">impacted</span>

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-14605">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14588">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-14558">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-14562">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-14604">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-14566">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-14560">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-14524">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14579">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-14554">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
<span class="marked id-unique-14604">time</span>. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-14539">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-14565">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-14603">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-14559">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-14580">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-14584">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen <span class="marked id-unique-14593">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-14600">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-14605">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-14545">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-14589">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-14606">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-14583">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-14522">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-14575">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-14581">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-14601">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14578">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-14564">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14568">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14563">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-14544">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-14599">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14585">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-14595">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-14589">almost</span>
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-14530">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14556">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-14599">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-14546">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14537">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14552">Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-14590">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-14597">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14598">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14594">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-14573">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-14571">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-14574">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-14592">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-14576">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14582">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-14587">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-14540">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-14586">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-14520">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14528">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14570">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-14525">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-14531">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-14590">We've</span> never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-14538">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14519">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14548">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-14523">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-14596">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-14555">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14553">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14543">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-14567">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-14557">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-14591">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14550">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14561">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-14602">Chaudiere</span>
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-14547">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14549">Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-14608">careful</span>
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-14569">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-14536">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14542">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-14535">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14533">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-14541">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-14527">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14607">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-14529">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-14577">municipalities</span>
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-14608">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-14572">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-14602">Chaudiere</span> River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-14521">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14518">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-14551">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-14577">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-14532">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-14526">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-14600">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-14603">border</span> with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-14534">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-14578">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-14554">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-14593">still</span> be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-14565">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-14559">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-14580">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-14603">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-14537">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14552">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14601">confirmed</span> that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-14581">died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-14588">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-14606">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-14599">get</span> into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-14544">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-14575">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-14545">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-14562">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-14604">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-14595">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-14589">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-14530">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-14556">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-14599">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-14546">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-14564">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-14568">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14563">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-14600">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-14587">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-14590">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-14590">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-14584">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-14522">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-14524">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
<span class="marked id-unique-14604">time</span> of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-14605">feared</span> for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-14589">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-14539">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-14583">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-14605">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-14596">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-14569">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-14531">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-14555">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14553">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-14543">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-14567">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-14557">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-14579">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-14520">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14528">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14570">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-14525">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-14538">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14519">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-14548">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-14523">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-14547">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-14549">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-14561">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-14602">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-14558">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-14566">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-14541">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-14527">concerning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14607">us</span>. We have <span class="marked id-unique-14529">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-14577">municipalities</span>
downstream to be <span class="marked id-unique-14608">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-14572">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-14602">Chaudiere</span> River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-14585">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-14536">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14542">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-14535">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-14533">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-14521">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14518">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-14577">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-14532">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-14551">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-14526">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-14600">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-14597">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14598">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14594">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-14573">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-14571">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-14574">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-14560">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-14586">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-14534">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-14592">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-14576">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-14582">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-14550">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-14540">likely</span> to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-14603">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-14591">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-19161">driverless</span> freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-19151">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-19148">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19192">dead</span>, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-19189">runaway</span> train with <span class="marked id-unique-19165">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-19188">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-19173">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-19168">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-19205">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several <span class="marked id-unique-19196">miles</span> away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-19147">crowded</span> at the
<span class="marked id-unique-19188">time</span>. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-19187">000</span> people <span class="marked id-unique-19156">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19172">lakeside</span> town, which
is <span class="marked id-unique-19149">close</span> to the <span class="marked id-unique-19141">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-19166">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19196">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19182">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-19167">destroyed</span> in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several <span class="marked id-unique-19175">hours</span>
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-19148">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could explode. <span class="marked id-unique-19186">One</span> carriage remained on fire
almost 12 <span class="marked id-unique-19175">hours</span> after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-19134">exclusion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19207">zone</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-19138">120</span>
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-19206">blaze</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19133">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-19145">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-19187">000</span> people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-19137">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19144">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach <span class="marked id-unique-19193">family</span> or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-19202">confirmed</span> late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-19171">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19174">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19170">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their <span class="marked id-unique-19193">family</span> or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
<span class="marked id-unique-19149">close</span>."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19185">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-19198">see</span> the centre of your town almost
<span class="marked id-unique-19167">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19150">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-19164">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-19159">event</span>."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-19199">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19200">Minister</span> Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-19178">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-19176">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19179">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-19196">miles</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19197">track</span> in Maine and
<span class="marked id-unique-19140">Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-19180">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19183">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-19130">unknown</span> how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-19142">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19146">driver</span> shift <span class="marked id-unique-19136">change</span>.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-19181">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-19190">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-19152">Somehow</span> the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-19158">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train <span class="marked id-unique-19131">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the <span class="marked id-unique-19128">wagons</span> come off the tracks. Everything
<span class="marked id-unique-19194">exploded</span>. In just <span class="marked id-unique-19186">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-19191">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
<span class="marked id-unique-19204">like</span> it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-19203">Bernard</span> Demers, who had to evacuate his
<span class="marked id-unique-19201">home</span> after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-19186">one</span> of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-19204">like</span> an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-19163">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19169">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-19160">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-19162">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19184">Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-19135">communities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19195">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-19129">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the <span class="marked id-unique-19139">air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-19155">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19157">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-19154">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19153">quality</span> of
the <span class="marked id-unique-19139">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-19195">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-19177">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-19132">neighbouring</span> municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is <span class="marked id-unique-19149">close</span> to the
<span class="marked id-unique-19141">border</span> with Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-19140">Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-19143">half</span> of Canada.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-19148">feared</span> in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-19192">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-19189">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-19194">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-19205">fireball</span> and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-19139">air</span>,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-19186">one</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19133">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19145">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-19187">000</span> people.

Dozens of buildings were <span class="marked id-unique-19167">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-19166">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19196">miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-19182">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-19158">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a <span class="marked id-unique-19132">neighbouring</span> village before a scheduled crew <span class="marked id-unique-19136">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-19130">unknown</span> reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-19188">time</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19161">driverless</span> train
reached the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-19131">travelling</span> at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-19151">speed</span>.

'<span class="marked id-unique-19204">Like</span> a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-19202">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19186">one</span> death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different <span class="marked id-unique-19193">family</span> members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-19138">120</span> firefighters have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-19206">blaze</span>, which
has continued for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-19175">hours</span>.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-19141">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-19147">crowded</span> at the <span class="marked id-unique-19188">time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the <span class="marked id-unique-19206">blaze</span> for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-19175">hours</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19203">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the <span class="marked id-unique-19188">time</span>, said he was lucky to escape and <span class="marked id-unique-19148">feared</span> for
those inside the bar.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-19204">like</span> a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was <span class="marked id-unique-19156">live</span>."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-19191">described</span> how <span class="marked id-unique-19149">close</span> she was to <span class="marked id-unique-19186">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19128">wagons</span>.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-19165">73</span> cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-19173">four</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19196">miles</span>) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-19142">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19146">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-19190">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-19152">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-19181">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-19143">half</span> a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars <span class="marked id-unique-19194">exploded</span>, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-19205">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre <span class="marked id-unique-19134">exclusion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19207">zone</span> was set up <span class="marked id-unique-19137">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19144">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

<span class="marked id-unique-19174">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19170">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-19199">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19200">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-19178">statement</span>: "Our

<span class="marked id-unique-19162">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19184">Blanchette</span>, adding that <span class="marked id-unique-19135">communities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19195">downstream</span>
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-19177">take</span> care if <span class="marked id-unique-19129">using</span>
river water.

A <span class="marked id-unique-19155">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19157">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-19154">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19153">quality</span>
of the <span class="marked id-unique-19139">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-19185">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 <span class="marked id-unique-19196">miles</span>) of <span class="marked id-unique-19197">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-19140">Vermont</span>,

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-19218">high</span> speed,
sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-19208">series</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span>.

At <span class="marked id-unique-19263">least</span> 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-19247">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span>
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-19231">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught <span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span>. The
subsequent <span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span> combined into a giant fireball,
with <span class="marked id-unique-19265">flames</span> shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-19255">sky</span> and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-19214">smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-19251">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-19272">000</span> people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with <span class="marked id-unique-19242">Maine</span> and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-19211">hearing</span> as many as six

almost <span class="marked id-unique-19213">12</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19235">hours</span> after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-19266">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120

Worried residents looked on amid <span class="marked id-unique-19219">fears</span> that friends and

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-19252">train's</span> cargo <span class="marked id-unique-19230">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of using river <span class="marked id-unique-19236">water</span>.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-19214">smoke</span> in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-19223">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-19237">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-19236">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

<span class="marked id-unique-19243">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-19227">called</span> in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-19215">help</span> deal with the <span class="marked id-unique-19216">disaster</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19267">Officials</span>
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-19215">help</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span> services in the
United States.

<span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span> is part of Quebec's <span class="marked id-unique-19250">Eastern</span> Townships
<span class="marked id-unique-19209">region</span>, an <span class="marked id-unique-19248">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19258">popular</span> with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-19242">Maine</span> and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the <span class="marked id-unique-19250">eastern</span> half of <span class="marked id-unique-19269">Canada</span>.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a
<span class="marked id-unique-19208">series</span> of devastating <span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span>. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-19257">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19259">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19254">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span>,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-19256">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
<span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span> and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-19263">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-19244">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The <span class="marked id-unique-19261">blasts</span> destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom <span class="marked id-unique-19229">clouds</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-19255">sky</span>.

A massive <span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span> sparked by the derailment of a train

<span class="marked id-unique-19214">Smoke</span> rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-19269">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several <span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span> and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-19220">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-19272">000</span> people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would <span class="marked id-unique-19222">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-19247">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-19224">give</span> an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't <span class="marked id-unique-19210">reach</span> a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-19219">fears</span> that five of the tankers cars
might still <span class="marked id-unique-19226">explode</span>.  Around 125 <span class="marked id-unique-19243">firefighters</span> were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-19223">lake</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19236">water</span> and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-19266">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
<span class="marked id-unique-19215">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the <span class="marked id-unique-19212">firemen</span> that we
need," <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span> chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-19240">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that <span class="marked id-unique-19243">firefighters</span> in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-19227">called</span> to a
<span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span> on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-19235">hours</span> before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that <span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span>
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-19242">Maine</span> & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-19242">Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-19270">parked</span> uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-19268">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-19264">going</span> to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-19270">parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-19245">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-19270">parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of <span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19239">late</span> Friday night. The two
town centres are about <span class="marked id-unique-19213">12</span> kilometres apart.  Joe <span class="marked id-unique-19262">McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-19242">Maine</span> & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning <span class="marked id-unique-19235">hours</span> Saturday
and "started rolling down the <span class="marked id-unique-19249">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-19252">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the <span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19228">took</span> place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-19242">Maine</span>, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-19238">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19241">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-19249">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-19246">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-19251">Witnesses</span> reported <span class="marked id-unique-19211">hearing</span>
multiple <span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span> and seeing <span class="marked id-unique-19265">flames</span> shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-19218">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of <span class="marked id-unique-19221">fire</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19229">clouds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19214">smoke</span> emanating from
the <span class="marked id-unique-19209">region</span>.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-19267">officials</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-19261">blasts</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19228">took</span>
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-19258">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19248">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The <span class="marked id-unique-19216">disaster</span> forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-19272">000</span> people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-19231">Shortly</span> following the
<span class="marked id-unique-19271">explosions</span> a Facebook group was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-19215">help</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19253">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-19217">phone</span>.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-19237">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-19216">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-19272">000</span> to shut off the drinking <span class="marked id-unique-19236">water</span> supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-19230">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.
<span class="marked id-unique-19260">Lac-Megantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19233">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19234">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19232">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-19225">full</span>
of potable <span class="marked id-unique-19236">water</span> have been brought in for the residents.

Canada: Train <span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of <span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span>.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-19294">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19357">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-19324">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-19329">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-19293">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-19333">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-19327">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span> combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-19287">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19346">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-19320">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span> away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
<span class="marked id-unique-19293">time</span>. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-19305">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19332">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-19280">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-19325">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19347">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-19326">destroyed</span> in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-19351">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be <span class="marked id-unique-19374">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19367">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-19278">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-19294">feared</span> more of the <span class="marked id-unique-19358">tanker</span>
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-19311">explode</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19353">One</span> carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-19275">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-19378">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-19350">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-19285">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-19343">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-19348">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach <span class="marked id-unique-19361">family</span> or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-19373">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19345">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19376">last</span> night.

<span class="marked id-unique-19331">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19335">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19330">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their <span class="marked id-unique-19361">family</span> or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-19310">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-19277">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19352">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-19369">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-19275">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19326">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19296">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-19322">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-19277">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-19312">event</span>."

Police <span class="marked id-unique-19379">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19303">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19318">Brunet</span> said: "I can <span class="marked id-unique-19375">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-19276">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-19371">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19372">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19368">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-19341">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-19339">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19342">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19366">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-19344">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19349">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been <span class="marked id-unique-19338">parked</span> some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-19356">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-19338">parked</span> the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-19306">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never <span class="marked id-unique-19374">seen</span> a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-19355">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just <span class="marked id-unique-19353">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-19283">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19291">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19337">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-19288">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-19297">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-19276">We've</span> never <span class="marked id-unique-19374">seen</span> anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-19304">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19282">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19314">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-19286">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-19370">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-19353">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span>
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-19321">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19319">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19309">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19334">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19323">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-19365">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19316">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19328">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-19279">Chaudiere</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19274">River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-19313">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-19379">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19315">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19377">Blanchette</span> said
communities <span class="marked id-unique-19363">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-19354">careful</span>
of using <span class="marked id-unique-19274">river</span> water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-19336">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-19302">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19308">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-19301">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19299">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-19359">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-19307">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-19274">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-19290">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-19292">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-19273">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19363">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19354">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-19340">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-19279">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19274">River</span>."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-19284">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19281">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-19317">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-19273">municipalities</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19360">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19298">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-19289">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-19278">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's <span class="marked id-unique-19362">Eastern</span> Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-19280">border</span> with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-19300">province</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19362">eastern</span> half of Canada.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-19345">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-19362">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting <span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span>
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-19326">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-19353">one</span> person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-19320">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-19367">still</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-19374">seen</span> long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-19332">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-19325">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-19347">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span>
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-19280">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-19303">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19318">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19373">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-19353">one</span> person had <span class="marked id-unique-19348">died</span>. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-19375">say</span> how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-19357">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-19378">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a <span class="marked id-unique-19379">spokesman</span> with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-19277">get</span> into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-19375">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-19310">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-19343">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the <span class="marked id-unique-19361">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several <span class="marked id-unique-19358">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-19311">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-19329">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-19293">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-19369">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-19275">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19326">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-19296">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-19322">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-19277">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-19312">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-19331">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19335">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19330">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been <span class="marked id-unique-19338">parked</span> uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-19278">disaster</span>, said the
train was <span class="marked id-unique-19338">parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-19356">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-19276">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-19276">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-19351">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-19285">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-19287">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
<span class="marked id-unique-19293">time</span> of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-19294">feared</span> for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-19275">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-19295">Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-19305">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-19360">including</span> some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-19350">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-19353">one</span> akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-19294">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span>) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-19358">tanker</span> that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-19370">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-19336">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-19297">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-19321">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19319">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19309">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-19334">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19323">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-19346">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-19283">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19291">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19337">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
<span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span> as "<span class="marked id-unique-19288">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-19304">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19282">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19314">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-19286">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-19313">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-19379">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19315">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19377">Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-19328">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-19279">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) <span class="marked id-unique-19274">River</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19377">Blanchette</span> said the
<span class="marked id-unique-19324">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-19333">four</span> were
damaged by the <span class="marked id-unique-19295">explosions</span> and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-19359">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-19307">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-19274">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-19290">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-19292">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-19273">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19363">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19354">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-19340">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-19279">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19274">River</span>."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19352">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-19302">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19308">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-19301">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19299">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-19284">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19281">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-19273">municipalities</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19360">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19298">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-19317">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-19289">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-19278">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a <span class="marked id-unique-19379">spokesman</span> at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-19371">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19372">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19368">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-19341">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-19339">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19342">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-19327">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-19355">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-19300">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 <span class="marked id-unique-19364">miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-19366">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-19344">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19349">Brunswick</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-19376">Last</span> week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow <span class="marked id-unique-19274">River</span>. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-19316">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-19306">likely</span> to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-19280">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-19359">spill</span> from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine <span class="marked id-unique-19376">last</span> year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-19365">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-19393">freight</span> train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-19414">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19384">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-19394">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-19395">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-19406">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-19401">east</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-19411">Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-19389">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-19385">six</span>
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-19382">Huge</span> clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. <span class="marked id-unique-19403">One</span> carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-19416">zone</span> as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-19413">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-19383">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right <span class="marked id-unique-19412">now</span> because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19402">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I <span class="marked id-unique-19415">can</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19398">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-19409">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19410">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19408">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-19397">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-19396">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19399">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-19411">Montreal</span>, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-19388">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-19387">overnight</span> driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-19400">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-19392">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19386">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19380">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19381">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-19391">left</span> a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-19404">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
<span class="marked id-unique-19405">exploded</span>. In just <span class="marked id-unique-19403">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-19403">one</span> of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-19407">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right <span class="marked id-unique-19412">now</span> there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-19390">half</span> of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-19389">Inferno</span> In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At <span class="marked id-unique-19414">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19403">one</span> person has <span class="marked id-unique-19413">died</span>, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-19393">freight</span> train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-19392">full</span> of crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-19405">exploded</span>
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-19401">east</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-19411">Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war <span class="marked id-unique-19416">zone</span>.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not <span class="marked id-unique-19386">report</span> other <span class="marked id-unique-19381">injuries</span>.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those <span class="marked id-unique-19412">now</span> feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The <span class="marked id-unique-19411">Montreal</span> Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and <span class="marked id-unique-19405">exploded</span> in a <span class="marked id-unique-19382">huge</span> ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-19388">Joseph</span> R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that <span class="marked id-unique-19394">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-19407">train's</span> conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor <span class="marked id-unique-19391">left</span>),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-19390">half</span> a
mile outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-19402">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-19406">witnesses</span> reported between <span class="marked id-unique-19395">four</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19385">six</span> explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-19387">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-19400">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not <span class="marked id-unique-19380">yet</span> known if
there are any <span class="marked id-unique-19383">casualties</span>, but according to Radio-Canada
<span class="marked id-unique-19384">60</span> people have been reported missing."

About 30 <span class="marked id-unique-19563">buildings</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> were destroyed in

He added: "When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19550">almost</span>

how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-19559">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-19622">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-19608">Michel</span> Brunet said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-19543">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19524">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-19508">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-19554">we've</span> been told about people
who are not <span class="marked id-unique-19492">answering</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-19460">phones</span>, but you have to
<span class="marked id-unique-19436">understand</span> that there are people who are out of <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> and
on <span class="marked id-unique-19470">holiday</span>."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-19566">took</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19513">Twitter</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19455">release</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-19527">initial</span> statement, <span class="marked id-unique-19459">posting</span>: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-19528">impacted</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19530">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-19488">Atlantic - a</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19474">firm</span> that owns <span class="marked id-unique-19451">roughly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19496">510</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19598">miles</span> of track in Maine and

Company <span class="marked id-unique-19509">vice-president</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19467">marketing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19575">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
<span class="marked id-unique-19463">no-one</span> had been on <span class="marked id-unique-19541">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-19511">unknown</span> how the train <span class="marked id-unique-19477">ended</span> up out
of <span class="marked id-unique-19422">control</span>. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-19535">distance</span> from the
<span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> during an <span class="marked id-unique-19573">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19585">driver</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19448">shift</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19537">change</span>.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-19515">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
<span class="marked id-unique-19429">everything</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-19540">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-19506">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-19517">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19602">Somehow</span> the train <span class="marked id-unique-19549">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19518">released</span>.

"There <span class="marked id-unique-19490">appears</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19475">extensive</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19479">damage</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19563">buildings</span> but
we <span class="marked id-unique-19419">haven't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19549">got</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-19619">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19571">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19505">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19526">injuries</span>. But we
<span class="marked id-unique-19436">understand</span> that there <span class="marked id-unique-19613">likely</span> are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-19583">Eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19431">Yvon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19452">Rosa</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-19557">just</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19614">left</span> a bar when he <span class="marked id-unique-19427">saw</span> the
train <span class="marked id-unique-19442">speeding</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-19465">middle</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span>.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-19428">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19424">seen</span> a train <span class="marked id-unique-19514">travelling</span> that quickly into
the <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span>," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-19427">saw</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19507">wagons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19483">come</span> off the tracks. <span class="marked id-unique-19429">Everything</span>
exploded. In <span class="marked id-unique-19557">just</span> one <span class="marked id-unique-19464">minute</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> was
<span class="marked id-unique-19480">covered</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-19597">fire</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19569">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19591">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-19586">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-19600">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-19554">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19428">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19424">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19491">anything</span>
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-19609">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19567">store</span>, Dollarama, <span class="marked id-unique-19429">everything</span> that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-19580">gone</span>."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-19523">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to <span class="marked id-unique-19476">evacuate</span> his
home after the derailment, said one of the <span class="marked id-unique-19595">explosions</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19445">sounded</span> like an atomic bomb <span class="marked id-unique-19478">detonating</span>.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19617">hot</span>. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-19562">Chaudiere</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19504">River</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
<span class="marked id-unique-19536">communities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19501">downstream</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span> should be <span class="marked id-unique-19498">careful</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-19510">using</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19504">river</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19555">water</span>.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-19547">Right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19502">now</span> there is big <span class="marked id-unique-19552">smoke</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19551">air</span>, so we

the <span class="marked id-unique-19551">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-19615">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-19504">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-19589">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-19592">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-19503">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19501">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19498">careful</span> if they take their <span class="marked id-unique-19555">water</span> from
the <span class="marked id-unique-19562">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19504">River</span>."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-19570">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19565">workers</span> had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-19525">neighbouring</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19503">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-19603">Sherbrooke</span> and

said they had <span class="marked id-unique-19489">asked</span> for <span class="marked id-unique-19558">help</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-19597">fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19449">services</span> in the

THE <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of a <span class="marked id-unique-19522">picturesque</span> Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19433">wiped</span>
out <span class="marked id-unique-19432">yesterday</span> after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-19620">freight</span> train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-19577">hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19440">tonnes</span> of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-19578">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19601">speed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-19444">sparking</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-19516">series</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19595">explosions</span>.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-19544">60</span> people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-19594">feared</span> dead, after the
runaway train with 73 <span class="marked id-unique-19418">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19443">sped</span> into <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span>
in Quebec before <span class="marked id-unique-19482">coming</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-19521">rails</span> shortly after <span class="marked id-unique-19497">1am</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-19495">5am</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19437">UK</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19593">time</span>).

Four of the <span class="marked id-unique-19457">pressurised-tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19418">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19485">caught</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19597">fire</span>. The

<span class="marked id-unique-19435">visible</span> from several <span class="marked id-unique-19598">miles</span> away.

<span class="marked id-unique-19547">right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19502">now</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-19533">firemen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19419">haven't</span> been <span class="marked id-unique-19423">able</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19559">get</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19425">close</span>."

He added: "When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19550">almost</span>
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-19599">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19436">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-19559">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-19622">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-19608">Michel</span> Brunet said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-19543">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19524">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-19508">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-19554">we've</span> been told about people
who are not <span class="marked id-unique-19492">answering</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-19460">phones</span>, but you have to
<span class="marked id-unique-19436">understand</span> that there are people who are out of <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> and
on <span class="marked id-unique-19470">holiday</span>."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper <span class="marked id-unique-19566">took</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19513">Twitter</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19455">release</span>
an <span class="marked id-unique-19527">initial</span> statement, <span class="marked id-unique-19459">posting</span>: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-19528">impacted</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19530">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-19488">Atlantic - a</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19474">firm</span> that owns <span class="marked id-unique-19451">roughly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19496">510</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19598">miles</span> of track in Maine and

Brunswick in <span class="marked id-unique-19430">Canada</span>.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-19509">vice-president</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19467">marketing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19575">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
<span class="marked id-unique-19463">no-one</span> had been on <span class="marked id-unique-19541">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-19511">unknown</span> how the train <span class="marked id-unique-19477">ended</span> up out
of <span class="marked id-unique-19422">control</span>. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-19535">distance</span> from the
<span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> during an <span class="marked id-unique-19573">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19585">driver</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19448">shift</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19537">change</span>.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-19515">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
<span class="marked id-unique-19429">everything</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-19540">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-19506">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-19517">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19602">Somehow</span> the train <span class="marked id-unique-19549">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19518">released</span>.

"There <span class="marked id-unique-19490">appears</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19475">extensive</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19479">damage</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-19563">buildings</span> but

But we
<span class="marked id-unique-19436">understand</span> that there <span class="marked id-unique-19613">likely</span> are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-19583">Eyewitness</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19431">Yvon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19452">Rosa</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-19557">just</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19614">left</span> a bar when he <span class="marked id-unique-19427">saw</span> the
train <span class="marked id-unique-19442">speeding</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-19465">middle</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span>.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-19428">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19424">seen</span> a train <span class="marked id-unique-19514">travelling</span> that quickly into
the <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span>," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-19427">saw</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19507">wagons</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19483">come</span> off the tracks. <span class="marked id-unique-19429">Everything</span>
exploded. In <span class="marked id-unique-19557">just</span> one <span class="marked id-unique-19464">minute</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19417">centre</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19596">town</span> was
<span class="marked id-unique-19480">covered</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-19597">fire</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19569">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19591">Claude</span> Bedard described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-19586">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-19600">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-19554">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19428">never</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19424">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19491">anything</span>

there is <span class="marked id-unique-19580">gone</span>."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-19523">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to <span class="marked id-unique-19476">evacuate</span> his
home after the derailment, said one of the <span class="marked id-unique-19595">explosions</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19445">sounded</span> like an atomic bomb <span class="marked id-unique-19478">detonating</span>.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19617">hot</span>. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-19562">Chaudiere</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19504">River</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
<span class="marked id-unique-19536">communities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19501">downstream</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19553">Lac-Megantic</span> should be <span class="marked id-unique-19498">careful</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-19510">using</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19504">river</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19555">water</span>.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-19547">Right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19502">now</span> there is big <span class="marked id-unique-19552">smoke</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19551">air</span>, so we

the <span class="marked id-unique-19562">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19504">River</span>."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-19570">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19565">workers</span> had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-19525">neighbouring</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19503">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-19603">Sherbrooke</span> and

Canada: Train explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-19632">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19702">Canadian</span> town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-19700">driverless</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19699">freight</span> train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-19675">hundreds</span> of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-19655">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19696">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-19701">runaway</span> train with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>
in Quebec before coming off the <span class="marked id-unique-19631">rails</span> shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-19677">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-19688">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-19667">billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19644">smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-19711">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-19657">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-19678">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-19689">east</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-19715">Montreal</span>.

About 30 <span class="marked id-unique-19649">buildings</span> in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-19670">destroyed</span> in
the <span class="marked id-unique-19654">inferno</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19695">Residents</span> reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-19650">six</span>
loud <span class="marked id-unique-19693">blasts</span> soon after the <span class="marked id-unique-19680">derailment</span>.

Huge clouds of thick acrid <span class="marked id-unique-19644">smoke</span> could be seen still
rising from the centre of <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the <span class="marked id-unique-19680">derailment</span>.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-19692">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-19672">Worried</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19695">residents</span> looked on amid fears that <span class="marked id-unique-19648">friends</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-19705">loved</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-19704">may</span> have <span class="marked id-unique-19690">died</span> in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-19626">unable</span>
to reach family or <span class="marked id-unique-19648">friends</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-19652">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-19716">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19687">last</span> night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are <span class="marked id-unique-19672">worried</span>
because they <span class="marked id-unique-19706">haven't</span> been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-19639">can't</span> give out any information on what's happening
<span class="marked id-unique-19643">right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19671">now</span> because the firemen <span class="marked id-unique-19706">haven't</span> been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19694">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
<span class="marked id-unique-19670">destroyed</span>, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-19661">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19665">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-19642">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19634">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-19624">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-19646">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-19713">Stephen</span> Harper took to <span class="marked id-unique-19627">Twitter</span> to release
an <span class="marked id-unique-19635">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19684">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-19682">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19685">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-19636">impacted</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19637">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-19715">Montreal</span>, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-19686">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19691">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-19625">vice-president</span> of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-19653">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on <span class="marked id-unique-19641">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been <span class="marked id-unique-19681">parked</span> some <span class="marked id-unique-19638">distance</span> from the
town during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-19656">driver</span> shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-19628">sure</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-19717">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-19640">book</span>," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-19681">parked</span> the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-19623">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-19629">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19697">Somehow</span> the train <span class="marked id-unique-19679">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19630">released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to <span class="marked id-unique-19649">buildings</span> but
we <span class="marked id-unique-19706">haven't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19679">got</span> a full <span class="marked id-unique-19651">report</span> yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-19676">Eyewitness</span> Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-19698">left</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-19714">bar</span> when he <span class="marked id-unique-19673">saw</span> the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-19674">never</span> seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-19673">saw</span> the wagons come off the <span class="marked id-unique-19707">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

<span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> resident Claude <span class="marked id-unique-19710">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-19658">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-19646">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19674">never</span> seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-19662">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-19664">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-19633">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the <span class="marked id-unique-19680">derailment</span>, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-19668">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19666">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19663">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19708">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19669">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-19712">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-19643">Right</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19671">now</span> there is <span class="marked id-unique-19709">big</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19644">smoke</span> in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-19683">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-19659">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-19647">help</span> deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-19647">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

<span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an <span class="marked id-unique-19703">area</span> popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-19660">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>
One person has been declared dead after a <span class="marked id-unique-19700">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19699">freight</span> train carrying oil tankers derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-19655">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19696">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-19645">LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
<span class="marked id-unique-19671">now</span> haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-19700">driverless</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19699">freight</span> train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-19673">saw</span> and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-19632">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19678">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-19643">right</span> arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the <span class="marked id-unique-19680">derailment</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-19677">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames <span class="marked id-unique-19675">hundreds</span> of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>.

However, by <span class="marked id-unique-19716">late</span> evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-19688">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-19670">destroyed</span> 30 <span class="marked id-unique-19649">buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and <span class="marked id-unique-19698">left</span> dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-19689">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19659">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-19675">Hundreds</span> of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who <span class="marked id-unique-19706">haven't</span> responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-19704">may</span> have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-19654">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-19707">tracks</span> that
pass <span class="marked id-unique-19643">right</span> through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
<span class="marked id-unique-19676">eyewitness</span> accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, <span class="marked id-unique-19633">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-19626">unable</span> to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he <span class="marked id-unique-19698">left</span> the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and <span class="marked id-unique-19679">got</span> to what he thought was a safe <span class="marked id-unique-19638">distance</span> away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. <span class="marked id-unique-19680">derailment</span> and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-19634">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-19647">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-19711">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-19657">crowded</span> when the train flew off the <span class="marked id-unique-19631">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-19635">initial</span> blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-19683">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-19707">tracks</span>, was among the <span class="marked id-unique-19649">buildings</span>
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-19693">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-19664">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-19662">Metro</span> grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-19716">Late</span> Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-19701">runaway</span>.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-19715">Montreal</span>,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-19681">parked</span>
uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-19697">Somehow</span> it headed into town without a <span class="marked id-unique-19656">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-19646">We've</span> had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-19646">we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train <span class="marked id-unique-19680">derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-19686">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19691">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-19653">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-19625">vice-president</span>, told the
<span class="marked id-unique-19715">Montreal</span> Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
<span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train <span class="marked id-unique-19679">got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-19628">sure</span> what <span class="marked id-unique-19717">happened</span>, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-19640">book</span>. He had <span class="marked id-unique-19681">parked</span>
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-19623">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-19629">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-19697">somehow</span>,
the train <span class="marked id-unique-19679">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19630">released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-19717">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety <span class="marked id-unique-19641">Board</span> of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-19696">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting <span class="marked id-unique-19676">eyewitness</span> accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-19651">report</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-19692">blaze</span> had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-19687">last</span> night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-19667">Billowing</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19644">smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black <span class="marked id-unique-19644">smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard <span class="marked id-unique-19710">Bedard</span>, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-19674">never</span> allow <span class="marked id-unique-19712">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes <span class="marked id-unique-19642">absolutely</span>
no sense, and it makes me angry."

<span class="marked id-unique-19710">Bedard</span> said that is "mostly businesses <span class="marked id-unique-19670">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-19672">Worried</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19695">residents</span> watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-19648">friends</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-19705">loved</span> ones <span class="marked id-unique-19704">may</span> have <span class="marked id-unique-19690">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they <span class="marked id-unique-19704">may</span> just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-19661">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19665">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-19639">can't</span> tell you at the moment
whether there are any <span class="marked id-unique-19624">victims</span> or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a <span class="marked id-unique-19709">big</span> explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-19668">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19666">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-19663">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-19708">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19669">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-19703">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-19714">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there. It was a <span class="marked id-unique-19709">big</span> explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-19658">terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "<span class="marked id-unique-19708">Everybody</span> is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But <span class="marked id-unique-19671">now</span> it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-19647">help</span> people track down <span class="marked id-unique-19705">loved</span> ones
who couldn't be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-19652">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated <span class="marked id-unique-19695">residents</span> are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For <span class="marked id-unique-19671">now</span> we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with <span class="marked id-unique-19705">loved</span> ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-19713">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on <span class="marked id-unique-19627">Twitter</span>.  “<span class="marked id-unique-19682">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19685">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-19636">impacted</span>
in <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span>,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-19637">Horrible</span> news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-19684">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-19694">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of <span class="marked id-unique-19645">Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the <span class="marked id-unique-19660">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-19650">six</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19648">friends</span> at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't <span class="marked id-unique-19644">smoke</span>, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-19702">Canadian</span> Press

Canada: <span class="marked id-unique-19783">Train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of <span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span>.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-19739">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19803">dead</span>, after the
runaway <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-19769">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-19774">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-19738">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-19778">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-19772">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span> combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-19732">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19792">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-19765">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span> away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
<span class="marked id-unique-19738">time</span>. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-19750">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-19777">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-19725">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-19770">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19793">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-19771">destroyed</span> in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-19797">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be <span class="marked id-unique-19820">seen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19813">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-19723">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-19739">feared</span> more of the <span class="marked id-unique-19804">tanker</span>
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-19756">explode</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19799">One</span> carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-19720">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-19824">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-19796">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-19730">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-19789">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-19794">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach <span class="marked id-unique-19807">family</span> or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-19819">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19791">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19822">last</span> night.

<span class="marked id-unique-19776">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19780">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19775">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their <span class="marked id-unique-19807">family</span> or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-19755">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-19722">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19798">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-19815">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-19720">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19771">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19741">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-19767">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-19722">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-19757">event</span>."

Police <span class="marked id-unique-19825">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19748">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19763">Brunet</span> said: "I can <span class="marked id-unique-19821">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-19721">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-19817">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19818">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19814">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-19787">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-19785">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-19788">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-19812">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-19790">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19795">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> derailed.

He said it was unknown how the <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> ended up out
of control. It had been <span class="marked id-unique-19784">parked</span> some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-19802">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-19784">parked</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-19751">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
<span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never <span class="marked id-unique-19820">seen</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-19801">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just <span class="marked id-unique-19799">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-19728">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19736">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19782">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-19733">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-19742">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-19721">We've</span> never <span class="marked id-unique-19820">seen</span> anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-19749">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19727">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19759">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-19731">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-19816">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-19799">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span>
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-19766">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19764">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19754">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19779">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19768">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-19811">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19761">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19773">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-19724">Chaudiere</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19719">River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-19758">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-19825">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19760">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19823">Blanchette</span> said
communities <span class="marked id-unique-19809">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic should be <span class="marked id-unique-19800">careful</span>
of using <span class="marked id-unique-19719">river</span> water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-19781">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-19747">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19753">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-19746">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19744">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-19805">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-19752">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-19719">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-19735">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-19737">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-19718">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19809">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19800">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-19786">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-19724">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19719">River</span>."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-19729">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19726">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-19762">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-19718">municipalities</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19806">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19743">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-19734">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-19723">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's <span class="marked id-unique-19808">Eastern</span> Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-19791">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-19808">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting <span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span>
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-19771">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-19799">one</span> person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-19765">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-19813">still</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-19820">seen</span> long after the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-19777">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-19770">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-19793">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span>
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-19725">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-19748">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19763">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19819">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-19799">one</span> person had <span class="marked id-unique-19794">died</span>. He refused to <span class="marked id-unique-19821">say</span> how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-19803">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-19824">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a <span class="marked id-unique-19825">spokesman</span> with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-19722">get</span> into numbers, what I
will <span class="marked id-unique-19821">say</span> is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-19755">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-19789">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the <span class="marked id-unique-19807">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several <span class="marked id-unique-19804">tanker</span> rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-19756">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-19774">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-19738">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-19815">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-19720">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19771">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-19741">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-19767">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-19722">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-19757">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-19776">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19780">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19775">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
<span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-19784">parked</span> uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span>, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-19723">disaster</span>, said the
<span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19784">parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-19802">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-19721">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-19721">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-19797">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-19730">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-19732">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
<span class="marked id-unique-19738">time</span> of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-19739">feared</span> for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-19720">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-19740">Explosions</span> as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-19750">live</span>."

Firefighters, <span class="marked id-unique-19806">including</span> some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-19796">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-19799">one</span> akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-19739">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span>) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway <span class="marked id-unique-19804">tanker</span> that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-19816">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-19781">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-19742">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-19766">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19764">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-19754">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-19779">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-19768">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-19792">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-19728">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19736">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19782">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
<span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span> as "<span class="marked id-unique-19733">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-19749">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19727">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19759">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-19731">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-19758">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-19825">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19760">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19823">Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-19773">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-19724">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) <span class="marked id-unique-19719">River</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-19823">Blanchette</span> said the
<span class="marked id-unique-19769">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-19778">four</span> were
damaged by the <span class="marked id-unique-19740">explosions</span> and fire.

"We also have a <span class="marked id-unique-19805">spill</span> on the <span class="marked id-unique-19752">lake</span> and the <span class="marked id-unique-19719">river</span> that is
<span class="marked id-unique-19735">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-19737">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-19718">municipalities</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-19809">downstream</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-19800">careful</span> if they <span class="marked id-unique-19786">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-19724">Chaudiere</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19719">River</span>."

He <span class="marked id-unique-19798">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-19747">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19753">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-19746">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-19744">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-19729">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19726">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-19718">municipalities</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-19806">including</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19743">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-19762">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-19734">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-19723">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a <span class="marked id-unique-19825">spokesman</span> at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-19817">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19818">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19814">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-19787">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-19785">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-19788">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span>
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-19772">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-19801">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-19745">province</span>."

The <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span>, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 <span class="marked id-unique-19810">miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-19812">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-19790">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-19795">Brunswick</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-19822">Last</span> week a <span class="marked id-unique-19783">train</span> carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow <span class="marked id-unique-19719">River</span>. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-19761">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-19751">likely</span> to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-19725">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a <span class="marked id-unique-19805">spill</span> from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine <span class="marked id-unique-19822">last</span> year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-19811">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-23959">driverless</span> freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-23949">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-23985">dead</span>, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-23982">runaway</span> train with <span class="marked id-unique-23963">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-23970">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-23965">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-23947">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-23954">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-23969">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-23964">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-23978">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-23937">exclusion</span> zone as <span class="marked id-unique-23941">120</span>
firefighters battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-23936">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-23945">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-23940">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23944">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-23968">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23971">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23967">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-23981">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-23989">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-23948">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-23962">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-23957">event</span>."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-23974">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-23972">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-23975">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-23988">track</span> in Maine and
<span class="marked id-unique-23987">Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-23976">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-23979">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-23933">unknown</span> how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-23942">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23946">driver</span> shift <span class="marked id-unique-23939">change</span>.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-23977">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-23983">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-23950">Somehow</span> the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-23956">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train <span class="marked id-unique-23934">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the <span class="marked id-unique-23931">wagons</span> come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-23984">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-23961">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23966">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-23958">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-23960">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23980">Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-23938">communities</span> downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-23932">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the <span class="marked id-unique-23986">air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-23953">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23955">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-23952">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-23951">quality</span> of
the <span class="marked id-unique-23986">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-23973">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-23935">neighbouring</span> municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-23987">Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-23943">half</span> of Canada.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-23985">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-23982">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-23986">air</span>,
killing one and <span class="marked id-unique-23936">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-23945">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-23964">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-23978">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-23956">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a <span class="marked id-unique-23935">neighbouring</span> village before a scheduled crew <span class="marked id-unique-23939">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-23933">unknown</span> reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-23959">driverless</span> train
reached the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-23934">travelling</span> at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-23949">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-23941">120</span> firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-23947">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was <span class="marked id-unique-23954">live</span>."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-23984">described</span> how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-23931">wagons</span>.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-23963">73</span> cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-23970">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-23942">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23946">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-23983">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-23950">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-23977">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-23943">half</span> a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre <span class="marked id-unique-23937">exclusion</span> zone was set up <span class="marked id-unique-23940">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23944">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-23989">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-23948">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-23962">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-23957">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-23968">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-23971">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23967">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-23974">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-23972">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-23975">prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-23965">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-23961">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23966">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-23958">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman
<span class="marked id-unique-23960">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23980">Blanchette</span>, adding that <span class="marked id-unique-23938">communities</span> downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-23973">take</span> care if <span class="marked id-unique-23932">using</span>
river water.

A <span class="marked id-unique-23953">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-23955">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-23952">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-23951">quality</span>
of the <span class="marked id-unique-23986">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-23981">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-23988">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-23987">Vermont</span>,

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-23997">high</span> speed,
sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-23990">series</span> of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-24035">least</span> 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-24021">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-24007">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-24027">sky</span> and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-24023">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-23993">hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge <span class="marked id-unique-24016">clouds</span> of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-24033">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-24004">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
almost <span class="marked id-unique-23995">12</span> hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-23999">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid <span class="marked id-unique-23998">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to <span class="marked id-unique-23992">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-23996">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-24014">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-24009">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24010">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24008">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-24002">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the <span class="marked id-unique-23994">firemen</span> haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-24028">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-24036">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-24029">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24031">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24026">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-24011">took</span> to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-24025">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24013">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24017">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-24034">McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-24015">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-24019">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-24003">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-24000">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-24018">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-24020">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-24024">train's</span> cargo <span class="marked id-unique-24006">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-24001">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24012">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-24005">called</span> in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-24032">help</span> deal with the <span class="marked id-unique-24033">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-24032">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
<span class="marked id-unique-23991">region</span>, an <span class="marked id-unique-24022">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24030">popular</span> with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
<span class="marked id-unique-23990">series</span> of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-24029">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24031">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24026">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-24028">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-24035">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-24018">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom <span class="marked id-unique-24016">clouds</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-24027">sky</span>.

Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-23999">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would <span class="marked id-unique-24000">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-24021">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-24002">give</span> an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't <span class="marked id-unique-23992">reach</span> a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-23998">fears</span> that five of the tankers cars
might still <span class="marked id-unique-24004">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-24001">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
<span class="marked id-unique-24032">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the <span class="marked id-unique-23994">firemen</span> that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-24015">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-24005">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-24036">going</span> to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-24019">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-24014">late</span> Friday night. The two
town centres are about <span class="marked id-unique-23995">12</span> kilometres apart.  Joe <span class="marked id-unique-24034">McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-24024">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions <span class="marked id-unique-24011">took</span> place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24013">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24017">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-24020">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-24023">Witnesses</span> reported <span class="marked id-unique-23993">hearing</span>
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-23997">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and <span class="marked id-unique-24016">clouds</span> of smoke emanating from
the <span class="marked id-unique-23991">region</span>.  According to officials, the blasts <span class="marked id-unique-24011">took</span>
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-24030">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24022">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The <span class="marked id-unique-24033">disaster</span> forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-24007">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-24032">help</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24025">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-23996">phone</span>.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-24012">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-24033">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-24006">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-24009">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24010">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24008">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-24003">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-24107">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-24077">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-24081">shortly</span> after 1am

<span class="marked id-unique-24085">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-24079">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-24043">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24098">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-24073">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-24058">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-24084">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-24078">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-24099">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-24103">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen <span class="marked id-unique-24112">still</span>

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a

like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-24057">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24038">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24067">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-24042">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-24115">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-24074">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24072">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24062">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-24086">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24076">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-24110">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24069">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24080">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-24121">Chaudiere</span>
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-24066">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24068">Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-24088">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-24055">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24061">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-24054">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24052">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-24060">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-24046">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-24048">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-24096">municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24091">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-24121">Chaudiere</span> River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-24040">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24037">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-24070">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-24096">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-24051">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-24045">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-24119">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-24053">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-24097">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-24073">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-24112">still</span> be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-24084">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-24078">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-24099">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24056">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24071">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24120">confirmed</span> that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-24100">died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-24107">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-24118">get</span> into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-24063">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-24094">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-24064">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-24081">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-24114">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-24108">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-24049">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-24075">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-24118">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-24065">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-24083">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24087">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24082">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-24119">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-24106">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-24109">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-24109">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-24103">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-24041">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-24043">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-24108">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-24058">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-24102">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-24115">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-24088">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-24050">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-24074">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24072">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24062">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-24086">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24076">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-24098">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-24039">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24047">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24089">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-24044">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-24057">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24038">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24067">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-24042">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-24066">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24068">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-24080">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-24121">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-24077">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-24085">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-24060">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-24046">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-24048">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-24096">municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24091">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-24121">Chaudiere</span> River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24104">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-24055">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24061">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-24054">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24052">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-24040">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24037">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-24096">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-24051">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-24070">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-24045">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-24119">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-24116">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24117">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24113">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-24092">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-24090">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24093">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-24079">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-24105">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-24053">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-24111">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-24095">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24101">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-24069">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-24059">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-24110">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless <span class="marked id-unique-24135">freight</span> train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-24126">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-24136">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-24137">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-24146">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-24143">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-24131">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-24127">six</span>
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-24124">Huge</span> clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
<span class="marked id-unique-24125">casualties</span> had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24144">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can <span class="marked id-unique-24140">say</span> absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-24149">Prime</span> Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24148">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-24139">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-24138">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24141">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-24130">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-24129">overnight</span> driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-24142">happened</span>, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-24134">full</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24128">report</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24122">yet</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-24123">injuries</span>. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just <span class="marked id-unique-24133">left</span> a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-24145">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-24147">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-24132">half</span> of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-24131">Inferno</span> In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
<span class="marked id-unique-24135">freight</span> train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-24134">full</span> of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-24143">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not <span class="marked id-unique-24128">report</span> other <span class="marked id-unique-24123">injuries</span>.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a <span class="marked id-unique-24124">huge</span> ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"<span class="marked id-unique-24130">Joseph</span> R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that <span class="marked id-unique-24136">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-24147">train's</span> conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor <span class="marked id-unique-24133">left</span>),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-24132">half</span> a
mile outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-24144">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-24146">witnesses</span> reported between <span class="marked id-unique-24137">four</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24127">six</span> explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-24129">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-24142">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not <span class="marked id-unique-24122">yet</span> known if
there are any <span class="marked id-unique-24125">casualties</span>, but according to Radio-Canada
<span class="marked id-unique-24126">60</span> people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police <span class="marked id-unique-24140">say</span> one person has died in the accident, CBC News

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-24235">picturesque</span> Canadian town was <span class="marked id-unique-24152">wiped</span>
out <span class="marked id-unique-24151">yesterday</span> after a driverless freight train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-24277">hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-24158">tonnes</span> of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-24278">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24296">speed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-24162">sparking</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-24229">series</span> of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-24259">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 <span class="marked id-unique-24292">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24161">sped</span> into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before <span class="marked id-unique-24200">coming</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-24234">rails</span> shortly after <span class="marked id-unique-24215">1am</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-24213">5am</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24155">UK</span> time).

Four of the <span class="marked id-unique-24175">pressurised-tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24292">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24203">caught</span> fire. The
subsequent explosions <span class="marked id-unique-24202">combined</span> into a <span class="marked id-unique-24281">giant</span> fireball,
with flames <span class="marked id-unique-24165">shooting</span> into the sky and billowing smoke
<span class="marked id-unique-24154">visible</span> from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-24288">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-24235">picturesque</span> Canadian town was <span class="marked id-unique-24152">wiped</span>
out <span class="marked id-unique-24151">yesterday</span> after a driverless freight train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-24277">hundreds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-24158">tonnes</span> of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-24278">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24296">speed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-24162">sparking</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-24229">series</span> of explosions.

At least <span class="marked id-unique-24259">60</span> people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 <span class="marked id-unique-24292">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24161">sped</span> into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before <span class="marked id-unique-24200">coming</span> off the <span class="marked id-unique-24234">rails</span> shortly after <span class="marked id-unique-24215">1am</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-24213">5am</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24155">UK</span> time).

Four of the <span class="marked id-unique-24175">pressurised-tank</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24292">carriages</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24203">caught</span> fire. The
subsequent explosions <span class="marked id-unique-24202">combined</span> into a <span class="marked id-unique-24281">giant</span> fireball,
with flames <span class="marked id-unique-24165">shooting</span> into the sky and billowing smoke
<span class="marked id-unique-24154">visible</span> from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-24288">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-24276">inferno</span>. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-24244">hearing</span> as many as <span class="marked id-unique-24266">six</span>

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a <span class="marked id-unique-24310">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24363">Canadian</span> town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-24352">hundreds</span> of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-24326">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24369">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-24361">runaway</span> train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the <span class="marked id-unique-24309">rails</span> shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-24341">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-24353">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-24338">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-24365">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-24328">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-24342">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles <span class="marked id-unique-24355">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the <span class="marked id-unique-24325">inferno</span>. Residents reported hearing as many as <span class="marked id-unique-24321">six</span>
loud <span class="marked id-unique-24359">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-24358">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-24343">Worried</span> residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-24356">died</span> in their homes. Some were <span class="marked id-unique-24304">unable</span>
to reach family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-24323">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late <span class="marked id-unique-24351">last</span> night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are <span class="marked id-unique-24343">worried</span>
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We <span class="marked id-unique-24317">can't</span> give out any information on what's happening
<span class="marked id-unique-24362">right</span> now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24360">added</span>: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24332">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24336">Brunet</span> said: "I can say <span class="marked id-unique-24320">absolutely</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24312">nothing</span> about <span class="marked id-unique-24302">victims</span>… <span class="marked id-unique-24366">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24368">Stephen</span> Harper took to <span class="marked id-unique-24305">Twitter</span> to release
an <span class="marked id-unique-24313">initial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24346">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-24344">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24348">prayers</span> are
with those <span class="marked id-unique-24314">impacted</span> in Lac-Megantic. <span class="marked id-unique-24315">Horrible</span> news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24349">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24357">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company <span class="marked id-unique-24303">vice-president</span> of marketing <span class="marked id-unique-24324">Joseph</span> McGonigle said
no-one had been on <span class="marked id-unique-24319">board</span> when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some <span class="marked id-unique-24316">distance</span> from the
town during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-24327">driver</span> shift change.

"We're not <span class="marked id-unique-24306">sure</span> what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-24318">book</span>," he said.

"He had parked the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-24301">waiting</span> for
his <span class="marked id-unique-24307">relief</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-24370">Somehow</span> the train got <span class="marked id-unique-24308">released</span>.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full <span class="marked id-unique-24322">report</span> yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

<span class="marked id-unique-24354">Eyewitness</span> Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he <span class="marked id-unique-24347">saw</span> the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have <span class="marked id-unique-24350">never</span> seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I <span class="marked id-unique-24347">saw</span> the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-24329">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-24366">We've</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24350">never</span> seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-24333">Metro</span> store, <span class="marked id-unique-24335">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-24311">owner</span> Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-24339">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24337">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24334">hot</span>. Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-24340">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-24367">train's</span> cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "<span class="marked id-unique-24362">Right</span> now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24345">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including <span class="marked id-unique-24330">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an <span class="marked id-unique-24364">area</span> popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-24331">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-24326">high</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24369">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge <span class="marked id-unique-24347">saw</span> and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
<span class="marked id-unique-24310">picturesque</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24342">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his <span class="marked id-unique-24362">right</span> arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-24341">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames <span class="marked id-unique-24352">hundreds</span> of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-24353">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-24355">east</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-24330">Sherbrooke</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-24352">Hundreds</span> of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
<span class="marked id-unique-24325">inferno</span>.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass <span class="marked id-unique-24362">right</span> through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
<span class="marked id-unique-24354">eyewitness</span> accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, <span class="marked id-unique-24311">owner</span> of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
<span class="marked id-unique-24304">unable</span> to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe <span class="marked id-unique-24316">distance</span> away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was <span class="marked id-unique-24312">nothing</span> he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-24365">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-24328">crowded</span> when the train flew off the <span class="marked id-unique-24309">rails</span> just after 1 a.m.
The <span class="marked id-unique-24313">initial</span> blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-24345">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-24359">blasts</span>, along with <span class="marked id-unique-24335">Dollarama</span> and the
<span class="marked id-unique-24333">Metro</span> grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-24361">runaway</span>.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-24370">Somehow</span> it headed into town without a <span class="marked id-unique-24327">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "<span class="marked id-unique-24366">We've</span> had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think <span class="marked id-unique-24366">we've</span> blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-24349">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24357">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
<span class="marked id-unique-24324">Joseph</span> McGonigle, a railway <span class="marked id-unique-24303">vice-president</span>, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not <span class="marked id-unique-24306">sure</span> what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the <span class="marked id-unique-24318">book</span>. He had parked
the train and was <span class="marked id-unique-24301">waiting</span> for his <span class="marked id-unique-24307">relief</span> ... <span class="marked id-unique-24370">somehow</span>,
the train got <span class="marked id-unique-24308">released</span>," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety <span class="marked id-unique-24319">Board</span> of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-24369">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting <span class="marked id-unique-24354">eyewitness</span> accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a <span class="marked id-unique-24322">report</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-24358">blaze</span> had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-24351">last</span> night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  <span class="marked id-unique-24338">Billowing</span> smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should <span class="marked id-unique-24350">never</span> allow <span class="marked id-unique-24367">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes <span class="marked id-unique-24320">absolutely</span>
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." <span class="marked id-unique-24343">Worried</span>
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have <span class="marked id-unique-24356">died</span>.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24332">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24336">Brunet</span> told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I <span class="marked id-unique-24317">can't</span> tell you at the moment
whether there are any <span class="marked id-unique-24302">victims</span> or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an <span class="marked id-unique-24339">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24337">bomb</span>," he said. "It
was very <span class="marked id-unique-24334">hot</span>. ... Everybody was <span class="marked id-unique-24340">afraid</span>." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-24364">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-24329">terrible</span> for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-24323">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-24368">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on <span class="marked id-unique-24305">Twitter</span>.  “<span class="marked id-unique-24344">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24348">prayers</span> are with those <span class="marked id-unique-24314">impacted</span>
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “<span class="marked id-unique-24315">Horrible</span> news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-24346">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-24360">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the <span class="marked id-unique-24331">province</span>.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with <span class="marked id-unique-24321">six</span> friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-24363">Canadian</span> Press

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-24441">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with <span class="marked id-unique-24411">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-24415">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-24419">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-24413">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a <span class="marked id-unique-24377">giant</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24432">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and <span class="marked id-unique-24407">billowing</span> smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-24392">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-24418">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-24412">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-24433">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-24437">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen <span class="marked id-unique-24446">still</span>
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-24453">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-24398">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
<span class="marked id-unique-24442">almost</span> 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-24436">blaze</span>, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents <span class="marked id-unique-24375">looked</span> on amid fears that friends and
loved <span class="marked id-unique-24428">ones</span> may have <span class="marked id-unique-24434">died</span> in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-24454">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24431">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-24417">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24421">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24416">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-24397">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to <span class="marked id-unique-24452">get</span>
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24438">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-24448">see</span> the centre of your town <span class="marked id-unique-24442">almost</span>
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-24383">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-24409">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to <span class="marked id-unique-24452">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-24399">event</span>."

Police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24390">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24405">Brunet</span> said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… <span class="marked id-unique-24443">we've</span> been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-24450">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24451">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24447">Stephen</span> Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-24426">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-24424">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-24427">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-24445">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-24429">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24435">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the <span class="marked id-unique-24440">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-24393">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-24439">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-24373">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24381">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24423">Bedard</span> described the scene as
"<span class="marked id-unique-24378">dreadful</span>".

"It's <span class="marked id-unique-24384">terrible</span>," he said. "<span class="marked id-unique-24443">We've</span> never seen anything
like it. The <span class="marked id-unique-24391">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24372">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24401">Dollarama</span>, everything that was
there is <span class="marked id-unique-24376">gone</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-24449">Restaurant</span> owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an <span class="marked id-unique-24408">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24406">bomb</span> detonating.

He said: "It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24396">hot</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-24420">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24410">afraid</span>."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-24444">train's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24403">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24414">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-24455">Chaudiere</span>
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-24400">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24402">Christian</span> Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is <span class="marked id-unique-24422">big</span> smoke in the air, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-24389">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24395">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-24388">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24386">quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-24394">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-24380">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-24382">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-24430">municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24425">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-24455">Chaudiere</span> River."

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-24374">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24371">workers</span> had to be <span class="marked id-unique-24404">called</span> in from
neighbouring <span class="marked id-unique-24430">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-24385">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges, to help <span class="marked id-unique-24379">deal</span> with the <span class="marked id-unique-24453">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking <span class="marked id-unique-24387">province</span> in the eastern half of Canada.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning <span class="marked id-unique-24431">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they expected the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and <span class="marked id-unique-24407">billowing</span> black smoke could
<span class="marked id-unique-24446">still</span> be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-24418">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-24412">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-24433">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-24390">Michel</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24405">Brunet</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24454">confirmed</span> that
one person had <span class="marked id-unique-24434">died</span>. He refused to say how many others
might be <span class="marked id-unique-24441">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to <span class="marked id-unique-24452">get</span> into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-24397">give</span> any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love <span class="marked id-unique-24428">ones</span> missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-24398">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-24415">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-24448">see</span> the center of your town <span class="marked id-unique-24442">almost</span> destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-24383">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-24409">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-24452">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-24399">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-24417">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-24421">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24416">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-24453">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-24440">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"<span class="marked id-unique-24443">We've</span> had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think <span class="marked id-unique-24443">we've</span>
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-24437">blasts</span> came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area <span class="marked id-unique-24375">looked</span> like
<span class="marked id-unique-24377">giant</span> standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited <span class="marked id-unique-24442">almost</span>
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was <span class="marked id-unique-24392">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-24436">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a <span class="marked id-unique-24449">restaurant</span> near the blast site. "It was a <span class="marked id-unique-24422">big</span>
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's <span class="marked id-unique-24384">terrible</span> for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an <span class="marked id-unique-24408">atomic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24406">bomb</span>. It was very <span class="marked id-unique-24396">hot</span>. ... <span class="marked id-unique-24420">Everybody</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-24410">afraid</span>."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-24432">fireball</span>," he said.

Another <span class="marked id-unique-24373">resident</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24381">Claude</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24423">Bedard</span> described the scene of the
explosions as "<span class="marked id-unique-24378">dreadful</span>."

"The <span class="marked id-unique-24391">Metro</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24372">store</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-24401">Dollarama</span>, everything that was there is
<span class="marked id-unique-24376">gone</span>," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-24400">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-24402">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-24414">spilled</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-24455">Chaudiere</span> (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-24411">73</span> cars were filled with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-24419">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-24394">lake</span> and the river that is
<span class="marked id-unique-24380">concerning</span> us. We have <span class="marked id-unique-24382">advised</span> the local <span class="marked id-unique-24430">municipalities</span>
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-24425">take</span> their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-24455">Chaudiere</span> River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-24438">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-24389">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24395">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-24388">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-24386">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and <span class="marked id-unique-24374">rescue</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24371">workers</span> from several
neighboring <span class="marked id-unique-24430">municipalities</span>, including <span class="marked id-unique-24385">Sherbrooke</span> and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-24404">called</span> in to help <span class="marked id-unique-24379">deal</span> with
the <span class="marked id-unique-24453">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-24450">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24451">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24447">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-24426">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-24424">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-24427">prayers</span> go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-24413">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-24439">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the <span class="marked id-unique-24387">province</span>."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-24445">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-24429">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-24435">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-24403">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-24393">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-24444">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.
