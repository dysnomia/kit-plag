Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-412">death toll</span> set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-419">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-423">Police have said</span> they expect more <span class="marked id-unique-425">people to be <span class="marked id-unique-416">found</span> dead</span>
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-413">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-421">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-420">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-428">evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-427">000</span> people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-417">missing people</span>.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials <span class="marked id-unique-430">said the train</span> had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-418">started rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-424">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-429">number of <span class="marked id-unique-431">people</span> <span class="marked id-unique-432">reported</span> missing</span>
will be greater than the final <span class="marked id-unique-412">death toll</span>."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-431">people had been <span class="marked id-unique-432">reported</span> missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-435">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-436">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-421">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-434">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-415">Joe McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-414">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby <span class="marked id-unique-426">homes and businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-442">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-443">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-444">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-437">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-414">Stephen</span> Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-419">train derailment</span>
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-445">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-446">nearby</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-441">Chaudiere</span> river</span>, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The <span class="marked id-unique-413">train was <span class="marked id-unique-439">carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-421">crude</span> oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. <span class="marked id-unique-435">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-436">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> owns more

explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-439">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many <span class="marked id-unique-426">homes
and businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were <span class="marked id-unique-439">carrying <span class="marked id-unique-421">crude</span>
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-428">evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-427">000</span> people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-423">police said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-412">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-425">people who will be found</span> deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-424">Guy Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-431">people <span class="marked id-unique-432">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-417">missing</span>
than people</span> actually <span class="marked id-unique-416">found dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-435">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-436">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of <span class="marked id-unique-435">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-436">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, Edward Burkhardt
<span class="marked id-unique-430">said the train</span> was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-434">brakes were properly</span>
applied on this train." He <span class="marked id-unique-430">said the train</span> was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-415">Joe McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-435">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-436">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-430">said the
train</span> "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-418">started rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-423">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-422">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-440">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-438">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-433">New</span> Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-427">000 people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-429">number of
people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-421">crude oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-445">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-446">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-441">Chaudiere</span> River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-442">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-443">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-484">24 hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-465">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-453">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-500">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-459">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-462">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-449">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-467">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-466">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-502">lakeside town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-466">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-447">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-452">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-478">confirmed that
one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-480">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-481">reported</span> missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-463">Guy Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-462">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-464">people who will
be found</span> deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-469">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-455">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-480">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-462">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-507">town <span class="marked id-unique-508">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-501">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-509">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-456">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-490">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-473">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-510">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-451">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-511">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-512">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-513">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-482">Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-458">told</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-514">televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-450">news</span> briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-465">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-494">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-495">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-470">said the
train</span> had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-487">brakes were properly</span> applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-470">said the
train</span> was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-479">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-474">like a <span class="marked id-unique-489">movie</span>," said</span> Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-491">Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-492">scripted - but</span> this was live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-468">said.

<span class="marked id-unique-523">Environment</span> <span class="marked id-unique-524">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-525">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-526">Christian</span> Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-497">73 <span class="marked id-unique-498">cars</span> were filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-459">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-506">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-527">mobile <span class="marked id-unique-503">laboratory</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-528">set</span> up to
<span class="marked id-unique-529">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-530">quality</span> of the air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-515">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-496">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-454">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-516">statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-517">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-518">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-505">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-471">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-477">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-448">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-519">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-488">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-457">train</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-483">derailment</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-520">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-521">fires</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-522">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec</span>,"
<span class="marked id-unique-493">Harper said</span>.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The <span class="marked id-unique-475">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-494">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-495">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-485">500 miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-531">track <span class="marked id-unique-461">serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-460">Maine</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-504">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-499">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-486">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-453">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact <span class="marked id-unique-476">across the
border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-500">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-459">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-494">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-495">Maine</span> and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-537">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-538">crude <span class="marked id-unique-533">oil</span> exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-539">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 <span class="marked id-unique-540">miles) <span class="marked id-unique-535">east</span> of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-541">early on Saturday</span>.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of <span class="marked id-unique-544">people <span class="marked id-unique-545">reported</span> missing</span>
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-544">people had been <span class="marked id-unique-545">reported</span> missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-538">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-536">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-548">half a mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-534">news briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-550">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-547">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-536">Stephen</span> Harper</span> said in a <span class="marked id-unique-551">statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-552">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-553">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-549">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-542">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-543">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-532">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-554">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-546">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-537">train</span> derailment</span>
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-538">crude oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,<span class="marked id-unique-539">000 people</span>,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-538">crude <span class="marked id-unique-533">oil</span> exploded</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-541">early Saturday</span> in a small Quebec town about 160 <span class="marked id-unique-540">miles <span class="marked id-unique-535">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a <span class="marked id-unique-534">news
briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-541">early Saturday</span> morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette <span class="marked id-unique-541">early
Saturday</span> afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-538">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-548">half a
mile</span> outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-539">000 people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 <span class="marked id-unique-544">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-545">reported</span> missing</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-555">Canada: Train</span> explosions in <span class="marked id-unique-605">Lac-Megantic, Quebec</span>

THE centre of a picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-571">Canadian town</span> was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-559">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-563">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 <span class="marked id-unique-581">people were missing</span>, feared <span class="marked id-unique-568">dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-569">runaway</span> train</span> with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-605">Lac-Megantic
in Quebec</span> before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-587">crowded at the
time</span>. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-572">000 people</span> live in the <span class="marked id-unique-594">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-557">155 <span class="marked id-unique-576">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-558">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire <span class="marked id-unique-579">officials said</span> they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-577">exclusion zone</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-584">120
firefighters</span> battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-570">forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-575">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-572">000</span> people</span>.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-582">amid fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-565">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-601">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-602">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-566">see the <span class="marked id-unique-562">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-597">town</span> <span class="marked id-unique-598">almost</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-593">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-599">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-561">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-588">asking</span> ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-580">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-600">get</span> through this event</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-583">Police spokesman</span> Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-603">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-590">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-560">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-604">Thoughts & prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-589">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-615">miles of track</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-564">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-592">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-586">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-578">overnight driver</span> shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-574">parked the train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-562">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-606">train's <span class="marked id-unique-567">cargo</span> spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-596">Chaudiere
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-607">Environment <span class="marked id-unique-608">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-609">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-610">Christian</span> Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-611">communities <span class="marked id-unique-591">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-556">using <span class="marked id-unique-585">river</span> water</span>.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-573">smoke in the air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-612">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-613">monitor the <span class="marked id-unique-614">quality</span> of
the air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-596">Chaudiere River</span>."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. <span class="marked id-unique-579">Officials
said</span> they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-564">Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-595">Vermont</span>. Quebec</span> is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-619">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-624">Police have said</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-625">expect more <span class="marked id-unique-627">people</span> to be found</span> dead
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-616">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-622">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-620">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-629">black smoke</span> into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-628">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-618">missing people</span>.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-632">people missing</span>.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-626">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
<span class="marked id-unique-633">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-637">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-638">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-622">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-630">parked the train</span> and put the <span class="marked id-unique-636">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local <span class="marked id-unique-642">hotel for the night</span>.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-617">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-643">McGonigle told</span> La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-621">centre of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-644">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-639">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-617">Stephen</span> Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-645">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-619">train <span class="marked id-unique-634">derailment</span>
and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-616">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of <span class="marked id-unique-620">town.

LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-633">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-622">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-641">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the <span class="marked id-unique-634">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-626">Guy Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-625">expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-627">people</span> found</span> deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-628">000 people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-618">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of <span class="marked id-unique-637">Montreal,
<span class="marked id-unique-638">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-636">brakes
were properly</span> applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-619">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-646">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-640">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-635">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-623">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-642">hotel for the night</span>.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-621">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-630">parked
the train</span> and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-643">McGonigle told</span> Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial <span class="marked id-unique-624">police said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-629">black smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some <span class="marked id-unique-632">people are
missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-644">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-639">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-617">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-645">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-644">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
<span class="marked id-unique-631">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Firefighters fought the blaze for more than <span class="marked id-unique-683">24 hours</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-678">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-673">like a <span class="marked id-unique-688">movie</span>," he said</span>, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "<span class="marked id-unique-690">Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-691">scripted -
but</span> this was live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-693">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-694">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-696">73 <span class="marked id-unique-697">cars</span> filled</span> with light <span class="marked id-unique-659">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-686">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-697">cars filled</span> with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-654">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

<span class="marked id-unique-721">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec</span> (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-683">24 hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-665">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-653">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-699">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-659">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-662">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-649">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-667">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-666">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-701">lakeside town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-666">000 people</span>, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-647">155 miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-652">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-677">confirmed that
one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
<span class="marked id-unique-679">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-680">reported</span> missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-663">Guy Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-662">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-664">people who will
be found</span> deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-669">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-655">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-679">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-662">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-706">town <span class="marked id-unique-707">almost</span> <span class="marked id-unique-700">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-708">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-656">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-689">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-672">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-709">get</span> through this <span class="marked id-unique-651">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-710">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-711">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-712">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-681">Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-658">told</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-713">televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-650">news</span> briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-665">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-693">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-694">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-670">said the
train</span> had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-686">brakes were properly</span> applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-670">said the
train</span> was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-678">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-673">like a <span class="marked id-unique-688">movie</span>," said</span> Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-690">Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-691">scripted - but</span> this was live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-668">said.

<span class="marked id-unique-722">Environment</span> <span class="marked id-unique-723">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-724">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-725">Christian</span> Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-696">73 <span class="marked id-unique-697">cars</span> were filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-659">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-705">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-726">mobile <span class="marked id-unique-702">laboratory</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-727">set</span> up to
<span class="marked id-unique-728">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-729">quality</span> of the air</span>.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-714">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-695">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-654">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-715">statement.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-716">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-717">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-704">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-671">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-676">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-648">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-718">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-687">tragic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-657">train</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-682">derailment</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-719">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-720">fires</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-721">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec</span>,"
<span class="marked id-unique-692">Harper said</span>.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The <span class="marked id-unique-674">people of Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-693">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-694">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-684">500 miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-730">track <span class="marked id-unique-661">serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-660">Maine</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-703">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-698">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-685">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-653">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact <span class="marked id-unique-675">across the
border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-699">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-659">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-693">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-694">Maine</span> and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-7450">death toll</span> set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-7452">Police have said</span> they expect more <span class="marked id-unique-7453">people to be <span class="marked id-unique-7447">found</span> dead</span>
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-7448">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-7454">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-7451">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-7456">evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-7455">000</span> people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people <span class="marked id-unique-7457">reported missing</span>
will be greater than the final <span class="marked id-unique-7450">death toll</span>."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-7457">reported missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-7458">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7459">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-7446">Joe McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-7449">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-7462">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-7463">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7460">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
<span class="marked id-unique-7464">Chaudiere river</span>, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The <span class="marked id-unique-7448">train was <span class="marked id-unique-7465">carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-7454">crude</span> oil</span> from the Bakken Field

Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-7465">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-7456">evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-7455">000</span> people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-7452">police said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-7450">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-7453">people who will be found</span> deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-7457">reported missing</span>
than people actually <span class="marked id-unique-7447">found dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-7458">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-7459">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-7446">Joe McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-7458">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7459">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-7452">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-7466">Maine, Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-7461">Quebec and New</span> Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-7455">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-7454">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-7464">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-7462">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a <span class="marked id-unique-7472">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-7467">train</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7510">carrying</span>
crude</span> oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-7470">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-7468">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-7475">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-7490">lakeside town</span> of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-7474">000 people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-7469">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-7479">confirmed that
one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-7482">reported missing</span>.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-7470">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-7481">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-7470">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-7493">town <span class="marked id-unique-7494">almost</span> destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-7496">event," an <span class="marked id-unique-7497">emotional</span> Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-7498">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-7495">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a <span class="marked id-unique-7472">runaway
train</span>, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7488">Maine & Atlantic</span> Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-7477">like a movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"<span class="marked id-unique-7486">Explosions as if it were scripted - but</span> this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he <span class="marked id-unique-7480">said.

<span class="marked id-unique-7507">Environment</span> Quebec</span> spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-7489">73 cars</span> were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-7473">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-7506">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-7508">mobile <span class="marked id-unique-7491">laboratory</span> had been set</span> up to
<span class="marked id-unique-7509">monitor the quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-7499">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-7501">statement.

"Our thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-7502">prayers <span class="marked id-unique-7492">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-7471">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-7478">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-7503">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-7504">morning's</span> tragic</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-7483">derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-7505">subsequent</span> fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-7500">Harper said</span>.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-7487">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-7488">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-7485">500 miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-7511">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7512">Maine, Vermont</span>, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact <span class="marked id-unique-7484">across the
border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-7473">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7488">Maine and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-7517">crude <span class="marked id-unique-7514">oil</span> exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-7518">000 people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-7515">east of Montreal</span>.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-7513">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-7520">half a mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised <span class="marked id-unique-7522">news briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-7523">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7519">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-7524">statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-7525">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-7526">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7521">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-7516">families</span> and friends</span> of
those affected by this <span class="marked id-unique-7527">morning's tragic</span> train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-7517">crude oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-7517">crude <span class="marked id-unique-7514">oil</span> exploded</span>
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-7515">east
of Montreal</span>.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a <span class="marked id-unique-7522">news
briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-7517">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-7520">half a
mile</span> outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-7518">000 people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one person has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-7523">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7519">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7513">Stephen</span> Harper</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-7528">Canada: Train</span> explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-7536">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-7534">runaway train</span> with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-7545">crowded at the
time</span>. About 6,000 people live in the <span class="marked id-unique-7548">lakeside town</span>, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 <span class="marked id-unique-7540">miles <span class="marked id-unique-7531">east</span>
of Montreal</span>.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as <span class="marked id-unique-7544">120
firefighters</span> battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-7537">forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-7539">evacuation</span> of 1,000</span> people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-7543">amid fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-7532">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-7533">see the <span class="marked id-unique-7535">centre</span> of your <span class="marked id-unique-7550">town</span> almost</span>
destroyed, you'll understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-7546">asking ourselves
how we are going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-7551">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7547">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7529">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-7559">miles of track</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-7560">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-7541">overnight driver</span> shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-7549">parked the train</span> and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the <span class="marked id-unique-7535">centre of the town</span> was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-7552">Chaudiere
River</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-7553">Environment Quebec</span> spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-7554">Christian Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-7555">communities <span class="marked id-unique-7556">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-7530">using river</span> water.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-7538">smoke in the air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-7557">mobile laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-7558">monitor the quality</span> of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-7552">Chaudiere River</span>."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. <span class="marked id-unique-7542">Officials
said</span> they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-7560">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they <span class="marked id-unique-7561">expect more <span class="marked id-unique-7562">people</span> to be found</span> dead
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-7564">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-7565">people missing</span>.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
<span class="marked id-unique-7566">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-7571">parked the train</span> and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local <span class="marked id-unique-7572">hotel for the night</span>.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-7573">McGonigle told</span> La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the <span class="marked id-unique-7563">centre of your town</span> almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-7574">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7568">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper said in a statement: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-7575">thoughts and prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train <span class="marked id-unique-7567">derailment
and subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-7564">crude oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-7576">track serving</span> Maine, Vermont,
<span class="marked id-unique-7569">Quebec and New</span> Brunswick.

A <span class="marked id-unique-7570">lakeside town</span> that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, <span class="marked id-unique-7566">Bernard Theberge</span> heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-7564">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-7570">lakeside town</span>, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the <span class="marked id-unique-7567">derailment and the
subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. Guy Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do <span class="marked id-unique-7561">expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-7562">people</span> found</span> deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had finished
his run. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
<span class="marked id-unique-7576">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7569">Quebec, New</span> Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-7572">hotel for the night</span>.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the <span class="marked id-unique-7563">centre of the town</span>." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-7571">parked
the train</span> and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-7573">McGonigle told</span> Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some <span class="marked id-unique-7565">people are
missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly set up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-7574">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7568">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-7575">Thoughts & prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-7574">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-7593">24 hours</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-7582">runaway <span class="marked id-unique-7577">train</span> carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-7584">crude oil</span> derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. <span class="marked id-unique-7580">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-7578">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-7586">black smoke</span> could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-7585">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-7600">lakeside town</span> of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-7579">east of Montreal</span> and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-7590">reported missing</span>.

Lt. Guy Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
<span class="marked id-unique-7580">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-7589">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-7580">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your <span class="marked id-unique-7602">town almost</span> destroyed,
you'll understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-7596">asking ourselves how we
are going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-7604">event," an emotional</span> Mayor
Colette <span class="marked id-unique-7591">Roy-Laroche <span class="marked id-unique-7583">told</span> a televised</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7603">news briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of <span class="marked id-unique-7597">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7598">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the engineer had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

<span class="marked id-unique-7588">Bernard Theberge</span>, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment <span class="marked id-unique-7612">Quebec spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7613">Christian Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-7611">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a <span class="marked id-unique-7614">mobile laboratory</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-7615">set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-7616">monitor</span> the quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-7605">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7599">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-7607">statement.

"Our thoughts</span> and prayers <span class="marked id-unique-7601">go out to the <span class="marked id-unique-7581">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-7587">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-7608">affected</span> by this morning's</span> tragic train
<span class="marked id-unique-7592">derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-7609">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7610">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-7606">Harper said</span>.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-7597">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-7598">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-7595">500 miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-7618">track serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7619">Maine, Vermont</span>, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-7577">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact <span class="marked id-unique-7594">across the
border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-7617">carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-7584">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-7597">Montreal, Maine</span> and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to <span class="marked id-unique-11723">rise</span>

US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-11768">Bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11693">collapses</span> after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-11731">light</span> crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
<span class="marked id-unique-11674">killing</span> one and <span class="marked id-unique-11735">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11763">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about <span class="marked id-unique-11714">250km</span>
(<span class="marked id-unique-11809">155</span> miles) east of Montreal.

They <span class="marked id-unique-11675">include</span> a bar <span class="marked id-unique-11787">full</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11688">customers</span>. Police are <span class="marked id-unique-11645">trying</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-11710">account</span> for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-11755">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11721">uncoupled</span> from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-11740">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been <span class="marked id-unique-11676">immobilised</span>
in a <span class="marked id-unique-11727">neighbouring</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11751">village</span> before a <span class="marked id-unique-11656">scheduled</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11689">crew</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11746">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-11720">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11658">reason</span> had then <span class="marked id-unique-11811">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11775">rolling</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11741">downhill</span>
into Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-11737">Eyewitnesses</span> said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-11795">driverless</span> train
<span class="marked id-unique-11756">reached</span> the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-11722">travelling</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-11692">considerable</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11772">speed</span>.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-11779">movie'</span> The <span class="marked id-unique-11655">search</span> for more <span class="marked id-unique-11702">bodies</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-11791">expected</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-11744">continue</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-11686">dawn</span>.

Local <span class="marked id-unique-11667">media</span> have reported up to <span class="marked id-unique-11717">100</span> people missing.


"We have <span class="marked id-unique-11708">already</span> confirmed one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-11778">others</span>," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be <span class="marked id-unique-11678">greater</span> than the <span class="marked id-unique-11681">final</span> death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-11752">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-11766">different</span> family <span class="marked id-unique-11758">members</span>.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-11750">120</span> firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-11736">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-11796">continued</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-11808">24</span> hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
<span class="marked id-unique-11707">assisting</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-11737">Eyewitnesses</span> reported that the town <span class="marked id-unique-11696">centre - where</span> there
are a number of <span class="marked id-unique-11704">bars - was</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11767">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "<span class="marked id-unique-11694">chaos</span>" <span class="marked id-unique-11683">ensued</span>.


Firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-11680">fought</span> the blaze for more than <span class="marked id-unique-11808">24</span> hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-11814">patio</span> of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-11729">lucky</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-11764">escape</span> and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-11779">movie</span>," he said, <span class="marked id-unique-11724">quoted</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-11747">Associated</span>

but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-11784">live</span>."

A <span class="marked id-unique-11640">woman</span> described how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-11718">wagons</span>.

"There were some <span class="marked id-unique-11649">sparks</span>, and the <span class="marked id-unique-11801">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11670">lifted</span> and came to

<span class="marked id-unique-11659">ran</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11770">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11648">stopping</span>," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-11798">CBC</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11643">TV</span>.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-11788">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11783">locomotive</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11684">engines</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11806">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-11789">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-11731">light</span> crude oil, and

said an engineer had parked the train and <span class="marked id-unique-11660">put</span> the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local <span class="marked id-unique-11734">hotel</span> for the night.

Some of the cars exploded, <span class="marked id-unique-11690">creating</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11759">massive</span> fireball
and <span class="marked id-unique-11653">setting</span> fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-11802">businesses</span>.

Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-11814">patio</span> of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-11729">lucky</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-11764">escape</span> and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-11779">movie</span>," he said, <span class="marked id-unique-11724">quoted</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-11747">Associated</span>
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-11749">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-11754">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-11784">live</span>."

A <span class="marked id-unique-11640">woman</span> described how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-11718">wagons</span>.

"There were some <span class="marked id-unique-11649">sparks</span>, and the <span class="marked id-unique-11801">car</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11670">lifted</span> and came to
<span class="marked id-unique-11671">lie</span> on its <span class="marked id-unique-11650">side</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-11679">front</span> of me, but I <span class="marked id-unique-11644">turned</span> around and
<span class="marked id-unique-11659">ran</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11770">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11648">stopping</span>," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-11798">CBC</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11643">TV</span>.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-11788">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11783">locomotive</span>

was parked in the <span class="marked id-unique-11751">village</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-11665">Nantes - about</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11713">7km</span> (four

said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-11733">Joe</span> McGonigle.


Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-11662">PM</span> Stephen Harper: "What has happened is <span class="marked id-unique-11651">shocking</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-11646">truly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11742">devastating</span>" "It <span class="marked id-unique-11654">seems</span> that the brakes were

Some of the cars exploded, <span class="marked id-unique-11690">creating</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-11759">massive</span> fireball
and <span class="marked id-unique-11653">setting</span> fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-11802">businesses</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-11663">one-kilometre</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11739">exclusion</span> zone was set up <span class="marked id-unique-11748">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11762">fears</span> of

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-11769">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-11804">asking</span> ourselves how we

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement: "Our

those <span class="marked id-unique-11805">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-11780">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11771">tragic</span> train derailment

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-11800">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11812">spilled</span> into the nearby

<span class="marked id-unique-11842">Canada</span> train blast: Lac-Megantic death <span class="marked id-unique-11837">toll</span> set to <span class="marked id-unique-11816">rise</span>

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US <span class="marked id-unique-11862">rail</span> crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-11849">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast <span class="marked id-unique-11857">sent</span> a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-11824">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-11855">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-11826">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-11820">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

<span class="marked id-unique-11862">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11860">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11845">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-11830">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11825">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-11822">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-11834">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-11839">number</span> of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-11837">toll</span>."

He said some people had been reported missing <span class="marked id-unique-11861">several</span>
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-11818">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-11839">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-11848">described</span> how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-11864">around</span> and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-11858">five</span> locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-11860">company</span> spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-11835">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-11847">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-11863">brakes</span> on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-11817">Joe</span> McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-11859">Harper</span>: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-11841">happened</span> is shocking
and truly <span class="marked id-unique-11821">devastating</span>" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-11863">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a <span class="marked id-unique-11856">massive</span> fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-11846">nearby</span> homes and <span class="marked id-unique-11828">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid <span class="marked id-unique-11823">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers <span class="marked id-unique-11819">exploding</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-11851">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-11844">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we

of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-11838">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-11829">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-11850">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont,

off a <span class="marked id-unique-11839">number</span> of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-11828">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-11864">around</span> 30

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude

<span class="marked id-unique-11842">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
<span class="marked id-unique-11861">several</span> explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-11824">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death <span class="marked id-unique-11837">toll</span> would likely <span class="marked id-unique-11816">rise</span>.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-11834">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-11849">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-11823">fears</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-11858">five</span> of the tankers cars
might still explode.  <span class="marked id-unique-11864">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-11818">fighting</span> multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-11858">five</span> tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
<span class="marked id-unique-11819">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-11841">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-11846">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-11862">Rail</span> World Inc., the parent <span class="marked id-unique-11860">company</span>
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-11835">Edward</span> Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-11844">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-11863">brakes</span>
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-11863">brakes</span> were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-11847">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-11860">company</span> told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-11817">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-11830">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11825">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-11820">engine</span> was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-11840">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11843">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of <span class="marked id-unique-11862">rail</span> tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-11848">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
<span class="marked id-unique-11856">massive</span> balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-11845">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-11829">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-11839">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-11850">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-11822">reached</span> by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-11838">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-11831">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-11846">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11854">Chaudiere</span> River.

in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-11905">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-11947">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-11949">expected</span> to

"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-11940">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing

Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-11908">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11931">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the time, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-11873">escape</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11945">feared</span> for
those <span class="marked id-unique-11911">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11943">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-11947">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the <span class="marked id-unique-11866">Associated</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11923">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-11869">scripted -

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-11919">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-11877">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-11901">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-11948">filled</span> with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-11913">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-11880">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-11915">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-11932">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before <span class="marked id-unique-11944">going</span> to a local hotel for the night.

The cars <span class="marked id-unique-11948">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-11872">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-11951">Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field

Quebec Police: More Oil Train <span class="marked id-unique-11865">Deaths</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11949">Expected</span>

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-11893">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-11950">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-11949">expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-11918">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-11910">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-11903">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-11926">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-11942">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-11940">confirmed</span> that
one person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-11882">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-11933">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-11912">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three <span class="marked id-unique-11867">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-11874">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11871">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-11914">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-11936">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-11876">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11929">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-11899">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-11944">going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-11890">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-11892">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11909">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-11917">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11907">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-11868">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-11898">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-11880">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-11944">going</span>
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-11915">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-11932">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-11941">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-11943">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-11946">early</span> morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-11908">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-11945">feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-11911">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-11931">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-11905">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-11947">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-11873">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-11869">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-11886">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-11945">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-11919">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-11943">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-11895">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-11891">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-11894">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-11872">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-11906">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-11901">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-11948">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-11913">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-11916">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-11921">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-11934">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-11928">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-11885">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11887">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-11884">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11881">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-11937">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11938">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-11951">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-11922">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-11920">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-11924">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11888">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-11889">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-11939">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-11900">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-11883">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11878">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-11904">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-11951">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-11870">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-11902">500</span> miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-11935">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11879">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-11925">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11927">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-11875">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-11877">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-11896">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-11942">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-11930">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-11897">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-11972">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-11966">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-11971">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-11960">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started <span class="marked id-unique-11957">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.

Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-11953">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-11962">CBC</span> TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five <span class="marked id-unique-11979">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-11965">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-11954">overnight</span> driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by <span class="marked id-unique-11962">CBC</span>,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe <span class="marked id-unique-11977">McGonigle</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-11978">zone</span> was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-11963">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-11974">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11975">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-11968">statement</span>: "Our

and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-11973">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-11960">full</span> of crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-11966">exploded</span>
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-11971">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the <span class="marked id-unique-11972">crash</span> site as a 'war <span class="marked id-unique-11978">zone</span>.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-11963">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and <span class="marked id-unique-11966">exploded</span> in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the <span class="marked id-unique-11979">locomotive</span>.
"Joseph R. <span class="marked id-unique-11977">McGonigle</span> confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said <span class="marked id-unique-11977">McGonigle</span>. ... The <span class="marked id-unique-11979">locomotive</span>
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-11955">half</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-11952">mile</span> outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-11973">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on <span class="marked id-unique-11957">rolling</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-11962">CBC</span> News says
that "witnesses reported between <span class="marked id-unique-11965">four</span> and six explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-11954">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment

60 people have been reported missing."

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-12046">feared</span> in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-12035">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-12032">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-12036">air</span>,
killing one and <span class="marked id-unique-11986">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-11995">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-12014">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-12028">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-12006">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a <span class="marked id-unique-11985">neighbouring</span> village before a scheduled crew <span class="marked id-unique-11989">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-11983">unknown</span> reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-12009">driverless</span> train
reached the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-11984">travelling</span> at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-11999">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-12043">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-11991">120</span> firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-12044">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-11997">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
<span class="marked id-unique-12045">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and <span class="marked id-unique-12046">feared</span> for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was <span class="marked id-unique-12004">live</span>."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-12034">described</span> how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-11981">wagons</span>.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-12013">73</span> cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-12020">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-11992">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11996">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-12033">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-12000">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-12027">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-11993">half</span> a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre <span class="marked id-unique-11987">exclusion</span> zone was set up <span class="marked id-unique-11990">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11994">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-12039">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-12009">driverless</span> freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-11999">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-12046">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12035">dead</span>, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-12032">runaway</span> train with <span class="marked id-unique-12013">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-12020">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-12015">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-11997">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-12004">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-12019">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-12044">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-12014">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-12028">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-12046">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-11987">exclusion</span> zone as <span class="marked id-unique-11991">120</span>
firefighters battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-11986">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-11995">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-11990">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11994">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-12043">confirmed</span> late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-12018">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12021">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12017">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-12031">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-12039">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-11998">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-12012">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-12007">event</span>."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-12040">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12041">Minister</span> Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-12024">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-12022">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-12025">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-12038">track</span> in Maine and
<span class="marked id-unique-12037">Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12026">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12029">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-11983">unknown</span> how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-11992">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-11996">driver</span> shift <span class="marked id-unique-11989">change</span>.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-12027">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-12033">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-12000">Somehow</span> the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-12006">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train <span class="marked id-unique-11984">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the <span class="marked id-unique-11981">wagons</span> come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-12034">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-12045">Bernard</span> Demers, who had to evacuate his
<span class="marked id-unique-12042">home</span> after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-12011">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12016">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-12008">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-12010">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12030">Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-11988">communities</span> downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-11982">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the <span class="marked id-unique-12036">air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-12003">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12005">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-12002">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-12001">quality</span> of
the <span class="marked id-unique-12036">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-12023">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-11985">neighbouring</span> municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
<span class="marked id-unique-12044">border</span> with Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-12037">Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-11993">half</span> of Canada.

The <span class="marked id-unique-12106">train's</span> cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-12059">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12058">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the <span class="marked id-unique-12081">village</span> of Nantes - about 7km (four

Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-12069">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-12095">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the <span class="marked id-unique-12103">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-12077">added</span>.

The train was <span class="marked id-unique-12104">carrying</span> the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track <span class="marked id-unique-12054">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-12105">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12073">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12076">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-12065">lakeside</span> town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with <span class="marked id-unique-12105">Vermont</span> and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

One <span class="marked id-unique-12101">dead</span>, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-12101">dead</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-12087">driverless</span>
freight train <span class="marked id-unique-12104">carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-12085">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-12087">driverless</span>
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-12055">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-12065">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-12091">patio</span>.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-12057">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-12091">patio</span> fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-12047">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-12063">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-12103">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12066">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-12097">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-12089">destroyed</span> 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-12088">businesses</span> and left <span class="marked id-unique-12093">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-12074">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-12092">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-12059">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-12052">crowded</span> when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-12069">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-12062">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-12099">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
<span class="marked id-unique-12084">fires</span>, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-12056">railway's</span> operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-12078">runaway</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-12067">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-12100">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-12086">Somehow</span> it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-12053">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-12051">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-12083">zone</span>: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-12079">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-12054">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-12073">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12076">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-12105">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-12048">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-12095">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-12096">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-12100">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-12086">somehow</span>,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-12096">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-12075">Canada</span> is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-12094">black</span> box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-12085">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-12098">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-12064">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a <span class="marked id-unique-12058">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke <span class="marked id-unique-12060">continued</span> to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-12094">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-12099">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-12106">trains</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12104">carrying</span>
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-12088">businesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12089">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-12095">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-12082">Early</span> this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-12061">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small <span class="marked id-unique-12081">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-12095">set</span> up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-12050">reached</span> by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a <span class="marked id-unique-12090">local</span> school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them <span class="marked id-unique-12080">get</span>
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-12049">continue</span> to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-12099">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-12107">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-12068">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-12072">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-12070">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-12077">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular <span class="marked id-unique-12090">local</span> singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-12092">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-12102">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12071">Press</span>

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-12186">feared</span> in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-12137">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-12116">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-12174">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-12160">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-12182">buildings</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-12192">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-12145">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-12167">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-12184">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-12111">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-12187">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-12171">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-12147">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-12188">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-12131">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-12181">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-12123">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-12154">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-12108">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-12115">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12156">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12112">members</span>.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-12135">continued</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-12190">24</span> hours.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-12183">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than <span class="marked id-unique-12190">24</span> hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-12150">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-12172">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the time, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-12114">escape</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12186">feared</span> for
those <span class="marked id-unique-12153">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-12184">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-12188">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-12110">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-12127">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-12139">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-12161">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-12118">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-12143">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-12189">filled</span> with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-12155">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-12121">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-12157">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-12173">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before <span class="marked id-unique-12185">going</span> to a local hotel for the night.

The cars <span class="marked id-unique-12189">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-12113">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-12191">Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

<span class="marked id-unique-12178">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12179">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-12191">Harper</span> said in a <span class="marked id-unique-12164">statement</span>: "Our

and <span class="marked id-unique-12146">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-12138">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12148">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-12133">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman
<span class="marked id-unique-12136">Christian</span> Blanchette, adding that communities <span class="marked id-unique-12158">downstream</span>

of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-12169">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-12144">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-12176">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12120">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-12135">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-12190">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-12192">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-12131">expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-12160">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-12152">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-12145">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-12167">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-12183">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-12181">confirmed</span> that
one person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-12123">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-12174">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12154">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three <span class="marked id-unique-12108">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-12115">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12112">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-12156">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-12177">see</span> the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-12192">destroyed</span>,

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-12121">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-12185">going</span>
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-12157">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-12173">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-12182">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-12184">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-12187">early</span> morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-12150">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, <span class="marked id-unique-12186">feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-12153">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-12172">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-12147">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-12188">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-12114">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-12110">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-12127">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-12186">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-12161">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-12184">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-12137">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-12133">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-12136">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-12113">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-12148">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-12143">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-12189">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-12155">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-12158">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-12163">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-12175">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-12169">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-12126">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12128">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-12125">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-12122">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-12178">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12179">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-12191">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-12164">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-12162">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12165">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12129">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-12130">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-12180">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-12142">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-12124">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12119">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-12146">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-12191">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-12111">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-12144">500</span> miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-12176">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12120">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-12166">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12168">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-12116">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-12118">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-12138">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-12183">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-12171">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-12139">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

after a runaway train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-16390">light</span> crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-16482">exploded</span>
in the <span class="marked id-unique-16518">Canadian</span> town of Lac-Megantic.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16395">blast</span> sent a <span class="marked id-unique-16488">fireball</span> and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-16519">air</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-16431">killing</span> one and <span class="marked id-unique-16500">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16541">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-16483">Dozens</span> of buildings were destroyed in the town, about <span class="marked id-unique-16472">250km</span>
(155 <span class="marked id-unique-16516">miles</span>) east of Montreal.

They <span class="marked id-unique-16432">include</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-16526">bar</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16568">full</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16446">customers</span>. Police are <span class="marked id-unique-16402">trying</span>

into Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-16392">Eyewitnesses</span> said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-16485">time</span> the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-16534">reached</span> the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-16493">travelling</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-16450">considerable</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16554">speed</span>.

Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe

in the <span class="marked id-unique-16518">Canadian</span> town of Lac-Megantic.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16395">blast</span> sent a <span class="marked id-unique-16488">fireball</span> and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-16519">air</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-16431">killing</span> one and <span class="marked id-unique-16500">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16541">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-16483">Dozens</span> of buildings were destroyed in the town, about <span class="marked id-unique-16472">250km</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-16392">Eyewitnesses</span> said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-16485">time</span> the driverless train

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US <span class="marked id-unique-16595">rail</span> crash
<span class="marked id-unique-16616">Police</span> have said they <span class="marked id-unique-16610">expect</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-16609">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16622">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the <span class="marked id-unique-16607">Canadian</span> town of <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast <span class="marked id-unique-16634">sent</span> a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-16587">evacuation</span> of 1,000 <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span>.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-16629">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of <span class="marked id-unique-16599">Montreal</span>.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-16589">full</span> of customers. <span class="marked id-unique-16616">Police</span> are trying
to account for dozens of missing <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span>.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-16631">cars</span> reportedly uncoupled from a <span class="marked id-unique-16584">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16581">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

<span class="marked id-unique-16595">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16594">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16619">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised

into <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span>.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-16585">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we <span class="marked id-unique-16610">expect</span> there
will be others," said <span class="marked id-unique-16616">police</span> spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16604">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also <span class="marked id-unique-16610">expect</span> that the <span class="marked id-unique-16576">number</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> reported missing
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-16575">toll</span>."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-16579">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-16608">hours</span>.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-16576">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-16608">hours</span>
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
<span class="marked id-unique-16636">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-16621">described</span> how close she was to one of the wagons.

miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-16594">company</span> spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-16605">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-16620">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-16584">parked</span> the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-16596">brakes</span> on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16631">cars</span> filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-16578">Joe</span> McGonigle.


<span class="marked id-unique-16607">Canadian</span> PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16593">Harper</span>: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-16613">happened</span> is shocking
and truly <span class="marked id-unique-16582">devastating</span>" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-16596">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
<span class="marked id-unique-16609">found</span> the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-16631">cars</span> exploded, creating a <span class="marked id-unique-16598">massive</span> fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-16583">nearby</span> homes and <span class="marked id-unique-16591">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was <span class="marked id-unique-16632">set</span> up amid <span class="marked id-unique-16586">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers <span class="marked id-unique-16580">exploding</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-16625">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-16618">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-16590">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16603">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16606">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16602">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-16626">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16627">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16593">Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-16601">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-16583">nearby</span>

Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span> had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-16611">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-16632">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

caused by a train derailment that <span class="marked id-unique-16632">set</span> off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also <span class="marked id-unique-16632">set</span>
off a <span class="marked id-unique-16576">number</span> of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-16591">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-16623">around</span> 30
<span class="marked id-unique-16629">buildings</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16634">sent</span> large fireballs and mushroom clouds

oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-16614">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-16587">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span>. (AP Photo/The <span class="marked id-unique-16607">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16636">Press</span>, Paul

that the death <span class="marked id-unique-16575">toll</span> would likely <span class="marked id-unique-16577">rise</span>.  "We do <span class="marked id-unique-16610">expect</span>
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> who will be <span class="marked id-unique-16609">found</span> deceased,
unfortunately," <span class="marked id-unique-16616">police</span> spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16604">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also <span class="marked id-unique-16610">expect</span> that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> reported missing
than <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> actually <span class="marked id-unique-16609">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16622">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-16586">fears</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-16617">five</span> of the tankers <span class="marked id-unique-16631">cars</span>
might still explode.  <span class="marked id-unique-16623">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-16579">fighting</span> multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-16617">five</span> tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
<span class="marked id-unique-16580">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span> fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-16613">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-16583">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-16608">hours</span> before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-16599">Montreal</span> Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-16630">Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-16635">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-16595">Rail</span> World Inc., the parent <span class="marked id-unique-16594">company</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-16599">Montreal</span>, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-16630">Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-16605">Edward</span> Burkhardt
said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-16584">parked</span> uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The <span class="marked id-unique-16607">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16636">Press</span> that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-16618">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-16596">brakes</span>
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-16596">brakes</span> were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-16584">parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-16620">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-16594">company</span> told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-16584">parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of <span class="marked id-unique-16633">Lac-Megantic</span>, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-16578">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-16599">Montreal</span>, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-16630">Atlantic</span>, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-16635">came</span> loose" in the early morning <span class="marked id-unique-16608">hours</span> Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-16600">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16588">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-16581">engine</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-16609">found</span> about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-16616">Police</span> said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-16612">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16615">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of <span class="marked id-unique-16595">rail</span> tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-16621">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
<span class="marked id-unique-16598">massive</span> balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-16619">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-16592">500</span> and 2,000 <span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-16576">number</span> of
<span class="marked id-unique-16597">people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was <span class="marked id-unique-16632">set</span> up to help <span class="marked id-unique-16624">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-16585">reached</span> by phone.
The Red Cross had <span class="marked id-unique-16632">set</span> up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-16611">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-16601">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-16583">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16628">Chaudiere</span> River.

of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-16724">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-16683">crude</span> oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-16738">fireball</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16702">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-16714">one</span> and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-16725">Dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16734">buildings</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-16685">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-16682">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-16711">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-16641">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for <span class="marked id-unique-16725">dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span> people.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16646">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail <span class="marked id-unique-16686">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16721">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-16689">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-16719">time</span> the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-16715">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-16717">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> up to 100 people <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span>.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-16733">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16714">one</span> death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-16661">others</span>," said police <span class="marked id-unique-16704">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16696">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-16737">number</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span>
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-16736">toll</span>."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span> several
<span class="marked id-unique-16643">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16650">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16698">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16647">members</span>.

Some 120 <span class="marked id-unique-16654">firefighters</span> have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-16740">blaze</span>, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-16672">continued</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-16718">24</span> hours.

<span class="marked id-unique-16654">Firefighters</span> from across the <span class="marked id-unique-16640">border</span> in the US are

Eyewitnesses <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-16737">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the <span class="marked id-unique-16719">time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.

those <span class="marked id-unique-16695">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16641">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-16715">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the <span class="marked id-unique-16638">Associated</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16708">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-16645">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-16665">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to <span class="marked id-unique-16714">one</span> of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-16676">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-16703">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-16656">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-16680">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16716">filled</span> with light <span class="marked id-unique-16683">crude</span> oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-16697">four</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span>) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-16686">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16704">spokesman</span> told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16659">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-16699">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-16723">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-16687">brakes</span> on
"properly" before <span class="marked id-unique-16652">going</span> to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16716">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-16648">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the <span class="marked id-unique-16704">spokesman</span>, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16684">Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-16687">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-16738">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-16683">crude</span> oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-16681">500</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span>) of <span class="marked id-unique-16728">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16658">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,

Quebec Police: More Oil Train <span class="marked id-unique-16637">Deaths</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16717">Expected</span>

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-16672">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-16718">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-16683">crude</span> oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-16685">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-16714">one</span> person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-16717">expected</span> the death <span class="marked id-unique-16736">toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-16702">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-16694">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-16682">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-16711">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span>
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-16640">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-16733">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-16714">one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-16661">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-16724">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16696">Guy</span> Lapointe, a <span class="marked id-unique-16704">spokesman</span> with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-16737">number</span>.

"People are calling in <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> love ones <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span>, some
people are <span class="marked id-unique-16726">reported</span> two, three <span class="marked id-unique-16643">times</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16735">missing</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16650">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16647">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16698">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-16719">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-16729">see</span> the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-16685">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-16655">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16720">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16678">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-16652">going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-16669">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-16671">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16693">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16701">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16691">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-16644">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-16677">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-16659">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
<span class="marked id-unique-16686">company</span> of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-16687">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-16652">going</span>
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-16699">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-16687">brakes</span> were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-16723">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-16734">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-16641">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous <span class="marked id-unique-16739">crash</span> and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-16692">patio</span> at the
<span class="marked id-unique-16719">time</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16739">crash</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16653">feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-16695">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-16722">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-16689">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-16715">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-16649">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-16645">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-16665">live</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-16654">Firefighters</span>, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-16740">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-16714">one</span> akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-16725">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-16653">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span>) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-16703">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-16641">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-16674">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-16738">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16670">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-16704">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16673">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16741">Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-16648">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-16690">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-16741">Blanchette</span> said the
<span class="marked id-unique-16680">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-16716">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-16683">crude</span> oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-16697">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-16700">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-16706">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-16727">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-16713">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-16664">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16666">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-16663">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16660">quality</span> of the air.

<span class="marked id-unique-16654">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

<span class="marked id-unique-16654">Firefighters</span> from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a <span class="marked id-unique-16704">spokesman</span> at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-16730">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16731">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16684">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-16707">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-16705">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16709">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16667">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-16668">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-16732">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-16679">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-16662">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16657">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-16688">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-16684">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-16646">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the <span class="marked id-unique-16686">company</span> owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-16681">500</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16639">miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-16728">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16658">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-16710">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16712">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-16651">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span>
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-16656">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-16675">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-16640">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-16721">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-16642">cars</span> carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-16683">crude</span> oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-16676">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train <span class="marked id-unique-16773">derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-16763">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-16768">carrying</span> light crude <span class="marked id-unique-16767">oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16743">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-16765">one</span> and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-16762">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-16753">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span> reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started <span class="marked id-unique-16750">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have <span class="marked id-unique-16769">reported</span> up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-16765">one</span> death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people <span class="marked id-unique-16769">reported</span> missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-16769">reported</span> missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses <span class="marked id-unique-16769">reported</span> that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-16745">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to <span class="marked id-unique-16765">one</span> of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-16742">CBC</span> TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five <span class="marked id-unique-16766">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span> filled with light crude <span class="marked id-unique-16767">oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-16757">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-16746">overnight</span> driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by <span class="marked id-unique-16742">CBC</span>,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span> filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe <span class="marked id-unique-16748">McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-16761">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-16748">McGonigle</span> told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-16747">half</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-16744">mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16743">exploded</span>, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-16776">nearby</span> homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-16775">zone</span> was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-16755">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-16770">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16771">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-16759">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-16758">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16760">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16752">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-16754">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16772">friends</span> of
those <span class="marked id-unique-16756">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-16751">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16749">tragic</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-16773">derailment</span>
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-16776">nearby</span>
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-16764">added</span>.

The train was <span class="marked id-unique-16768">carrying</span> the crude <span class="marked id-unique-16767">oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least <span class="marked id-unique-16765">one</span> person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16753">full</span> of crude <span class="marked id-unique-16767">oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16743">exploded</span>
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-16762">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the <span class="marked id-unique-16763">crash</span> site as a 'war <span class="marked id-unique-16775">zone</span>.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-16755">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and <span class="marked id-unique-16743">exploded</span> in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the <span class="marked id-unique-16766">locomotive</span>.
"Joseph R. <span class="marked id-unique-16748">McGonigle</span> confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in <span class="marked id-unique-16776">nearby</span> Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16768">carrying</span>
thousands of liters of crude <span class="marked id-unique-16767">oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said <span class="marked id-unique-16748">McGonigle</span>. ... The <span class="marked id-unique-16766">locomotive</span>
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-16747">half</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-16744">mile</span> outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-16764">added</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-16774">cars</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16768">carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16767">oil</span> kept right on <span class="marked id-unique-16750">rolling</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-16742">CBC</span> News says
that "witnesses <span class="marked id-unique-16769">reported</span> between <span class="marked id-unique-16757">four</span> and six explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-16746">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The <span class="marked id-unique-16773">derailment</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16761">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been <span class="marked id-unique-16769">reported</span> missing."

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-16797">feared</span> in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-16841">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-16838">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-16843">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-16854">fireball</span> and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-16788">air</span>,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-16835">one</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16782">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16794">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-16836">000</span> people.

Dozens of buildings were <span class="marked id-unique-16816">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-16815">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16845">miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-16831">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-16807">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a <span class="marked id-unique-16781">neighbouring</span> village before a scheduled crew <span class="marked id-unique-16785">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-16779">unknown</span> reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-16837">time</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16810">driverless</span> train
reached the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-16780">travelling</span> at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-16800">speed</span>.

'<span class="marked id-unique-16853">Like</span> a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-16851">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16835">one</span> death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different <span class="marked id-unique-16842">family</span> members.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-16787">120</span> firefighters have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-16855">blaze</span>, which
has continued for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-16824">hours</span>.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-16790">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was <span class="marked id-unique-16796">crowded</span> at the <span class="marked id-unique-16837">time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the <span class="marked id-unique-16855">blaze</span> for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-16824">hours</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16852">Bernard</span> Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the <span class="marked id-unique-16837">time</span>, said he was lucky to escape and <span class="marked id-unique-16797">feared</span> for
those inside the bar.

"It was <span class="marked id-unique-16853">like</span> a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was <span class="marked id-unique-16805">live</span>."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-16840">described</span> how <span class="marked id-unique-16798">close</span> she was to <span class="marked id-unique-16835">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16777">wagons</span>.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-16814">73</span> cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-16822">four</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16845">miles</span>) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-16791">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16795">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-16839">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-16801">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-16830">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-16792">half</span> a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars <span class="marked id-unique-16843">exploded</span>, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-16854">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre <span class="marked id-unique-16783">exclusion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16856">zone</span> was set up <span class="marked id-unique-16786">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16793">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-16847">see</span> the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-16816">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-16799">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16813">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-16808">event</span>," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-16820">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16823">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16819">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-16848">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16849">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-16827">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-16825">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16828">prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-16817">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-16812">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16818">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-16809">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman
<span class="marked id-unique-16811">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16833">Blanchette</span>, adding that <span class="marked id-unique-16784">communities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16844">downstream</span>
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-16826">take</span> care if <span class="marked id-unique-16778">using</span>
river water.

A <span class="marked id-unique-16804">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16806">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-16803">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16802">quality</span>
of the <span class="marked id-unique-16788">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-16834">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 <span class="marked id-unique-16845">miles</span>) of <span class="marked id-unique-16846">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16789">Vermont</span>,

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-16810">driverless</span> freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-16800">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, <span class="marked id-unique-16797">feared</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16841">dead</span>, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-16838">runaway</span> train with <span class="marked id-unique-16814">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK <span class="marked id-unique-16837">time</span>).

<span class="marked id-unique-16822">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-16817">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant <span class="marked id-unique-16854">fireball</span>,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several <span class="marked id-unique-16845">miles</span> away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-16796">crowded</span> at the
<span class="marked id-unique-16837">time</span>. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-16836">000</span> people <span class="marked id-unique-16805">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-16821">lakeside</span> town, which
is <span class="marked id-unique-16798">close</span> to the <span class="marked id-unique-16790">border</span> with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-16815">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16845">miles</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16831">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were <span class="marked id-unique-16816">destroyed</span> in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several <span class="marked id-unique-16824">hours</span>
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they <span class="marked id-unique-16797">feared</span> more of the tanker
carriages could explode. <span class="marked id-unique-16835">One</span> carriage remained on fire
almost 12 <span class="marked id-unique-16824">hours</span> after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-16783">exclusion</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16856">zone</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-16787">120</span>
firefighters battled to control the <span class="marked id-unique-16855">blaze</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16782">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-16794">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-16836">000</span> people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-16786">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16793">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach <span class="marked id-unique-16842">family</span> or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been <span class="marked id-unique-16851">confirmed</span> late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-16820">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16823">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16819">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their <span class="marked id-unique-16842">family</span> or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
<span class="marked id-unique-16798">close</span>."

He <span class="marked id-unique-16834">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-16847">see</span> the centre of your town almost
<span class="marked id-unique-16816">destroyed</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16799">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16813">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-16808">event</span>."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-16848">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16849">Minister</span> Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-16827">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-16825">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-16828">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 <span class="marked id-unique-16845">miles</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-16846">track</span> in Maine and
<span class="marked id-unique-16789">Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-16829">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16832">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-16779">unknown</span> how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-16791">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16795">driver</span> shift <span class="marked id-unique-16785">change</span>.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-16830">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-16839">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-16801">Somehow</span> the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-16807">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train <span class="marked id-unique-16780">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the <span class="marked id-unique-16777">wagons</span> come off the tracks. Everything
<span class="marked id-unique-16843">exploded</span>. In just <span class="marked id-unique-16835">one</span> minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-16840">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
<span class="marked id-unique-16853">like</span> it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner <span class="marked id-unique-16852">Bernard</span> Demers, who had to evacuate his
<span class="marked id-unique-16850">home</span> after the derailment, said <span class="marked id-unique-16835">one</span> of the explosions
sounded <span class="marked id-unique-16853">like</span> an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-16812">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16818">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-16809">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-16811">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16833">Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-16784">communities</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16844">downstream</span> of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-16778">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the <span class="marked id-unique-16788">air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-16804">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16806">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-16803">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16802">quality</span> of
the <span class="marked id-unique-16788">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-16844">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-16826">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-16781">neighbouring</span> municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is <span class="marked id-unique-16798">close</span> to the
<span class="marked id-unique-16790">border</span> with Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-16789">Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-16792">half</span> of Canada.

Some 120 <span class="marked id-unique-16864">firefighters</span> have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-16912">blaze</span>, which

said an <span class="marked id-unique-16917">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-16923">parked</span> the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-16914">brakes</span> on
"properly" before going to a <span class="marked id-unique-16877">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16858">hotel</span> for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-16896">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe <span class="marked id-unique-16900">McGonigle</span>.


<span class="marked id-unique-16919">Canadian</span> PM <span class="marked id-unique-16926">Stephen</span> Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-16910">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-16914">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr <span class="marked id-unique-16900">McGonigle</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-16911">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-16898">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-16915">zone</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-16860">set</span> up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-16875">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-16908">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-16927">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16928">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16926">Stephen</span> Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-16887">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-16885">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16889">prayers</span> go out to the families and <span class="marked id-unique-16930">friends</span> of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-16879">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16916">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-16922">Quebec</span>.

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-16925">train's</span> cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment <span class="marked id-unique-16922">Quebec</span> spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-16886">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-16860">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the <span class="marked id-unique-16920">air</span>, he <span class="marked id-unique-16894">added</span>.

The train was <span class="marked id-unique-16903">carrying</span> the crude <span class="marked id-unique-16899">oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track <span class="marked id-unique-16866">serving</span> Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-16924">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-16922">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16890">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16893">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-16881">lakeside</span> town that is <span class="marked id-unique-16929">home</span> to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the <span class="marked id-unique-16876">US</span> border with <span class="marked id-unique-16924">Vermont</span> and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

One <span class="marked id-unique-16918">dead</span>, many <span class="marked id-unique-16909">missing</span> as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-16918">dead</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-16897">driverless</span>
freight train <span class="marked id-unique-16903">carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16899">oil</span> tankers derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-16895">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-16897">driverless</span>
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude <span class="marked id-unique-16899">oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-16867">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-16881">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-16904">patio</span>.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-16869">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-16904">patio</span> fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-16857">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-16879">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the <span class="marked id-unique-16920">air</span> and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16882">Guy</span> Lapointe of the <span class="marked id-unique-16922">Quebec</span>
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-16911">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-16875">destroyed</span> 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-16898">businesses</span> and left <span class="marked id-unique-16906">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-16891">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-16909">missing</span> people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-16905">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his <span class="marked id-unique-16929">home</span>.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-16871">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-16863">crowded</span> when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial <span class="marked id-unique-16921">blast</span> was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-16886">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-16874">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-16864">firefighters</span> assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
<span class="marked id-unique-16916">fires</span>, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-16868">railway's</span> operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-16901">runaway</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-16883">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-16923">parked</span>
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-16917">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-16896">Somehow</span> it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-16865">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-16862">driver</span>.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-16914">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-16914">brakes</span>
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-16915">zone</span>: <span class="marked id-unique-16922">Quebec</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16902">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-16866">serving</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16922">Quebec</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16890">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16893">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-16924">Vermont</span>.
Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-16900">McGonigle</span>, a railway vice-president, <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the <span class="marked id-unique-16914">brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-16858">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said <span class="marked id-unique-16900">McGonigle</span>. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-16860">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-16910">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-16917">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-16923">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-16896">somehow</span>,
the train got released," <span class="marked id-unique-16900">McGonigle</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> Reuters.
"That's what confuses <span class="marked id-unique-16876">us</span>. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-16910">happened</span> is just beyond
<span class="marked id-unique-16876">us</span>." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-16892">Canada</span> is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-16907">black</span> box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-16895">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-16912">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-16880">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a <span class="marked id-unique-16870">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke <span class="marked id-unique-16872">continued</span> to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-16907">black</span> smoke and lots of <span class="marked id-unique-16864">firefighters</span>. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-16925">trains</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16903">carrying</span>
that much <span class="marked id-unique-16899">oil</span> to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-16898">businesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16875">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-16860">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their <span class="marked id-unique-16930">friends</span>
and loved ones may have died.  "We're <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> some people are
<span class="marked id-unique-16909">missing</span> but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-16884">told</span> reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his <span class="marked id-unique-16929">home</span>.  "<span class="marked id-unique-16913">Early</span> this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-16873">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small <span class="marked id-unique-16878">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-16860">set</span> up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-16861">reached</span> by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a <span class="marked id-unique-16877">local</span> school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them <span class="marked id-unique-16908">get</span>
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-16859">continue</span> to assist
as long as the authorities want <span class="marked id-unique-16876">us</span> to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-16864">firefighters</span> on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-16927">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16928">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16926">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-16885">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-16889">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-16887">statement</span> later, the <span class="marked id-unique-16927">prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16928">minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16894">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six <span class="marked id-unique-16930">friends</span> at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular <span class="marked id-unique-16877">local</span> singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-16905">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from <span class="marked id-unique-16919">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16888">Press</span>

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death <span class="marked id-unique-17027">toll</span> set to rise

Deaths <span class="marked id-unique-16945">feared</span> in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-16967">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-16943">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-17030">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-17015">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light <span class="marked id-unique-16976">crude</span> oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a <span class="marked id-unique-17029">fireball</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16995">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing <span class="marked id-unique-17006">one</span> and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

<span class="marked id-unique-17016">Dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17025">buildings</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-16978">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-16975">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span>) <span class="marked id-unique-17003">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-16933">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for <span class="marked id-unique-17016">dozens</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span> people.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16938">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed <span class="marked id-unique-17033">early</span> on Saturday.

Rail <span class="marked id-unique-16979">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17012">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-16982">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the <span class="marked id-unique-17010">time</span> the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-17007">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-16961">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> up to 100 people <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span>.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-17024">confirmed</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17006">one</span> death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-16953">others</span>," said police <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16989">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-17028">number</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span>
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-17027">toll</span>."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span> several
<span class="marked id-unique-16935">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16942">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16991">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16939">members</span>.

Some 120 <span class="marked id-unique-16946">firefighters</span> have been fighting the <span class="marked id-unique-17031">blaze</span>, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-16965">continued</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-17009">24</span> hours.

<span class="marked id-unique-16946">Firefighters</span> from across the <span class="marked id-unique-16932">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-17028">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the <span class="marked id-unique-17010">time</span> of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


<span class="marked id-unique-16946">Firefighters</span> fought the <span class="marked id-unique-17031">blaze</span> for more than <span class="marked id-unique-17009">24</span> hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-16985">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-17013">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the <span class="marked id-unique-17010">time</span>, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-16941">escape</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-16945">feared</span> for
those <span class="marked id-unique-16988">inside</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16933">bar</span>.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-17007">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-16937">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-16957">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to <span class="marked id-unique-17006">one</span> of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-16969">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-16996">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-16948">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-16973">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17008">filled</span> with light <span class="marked id-unique-16976">crude</span> oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-16990">four</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span>) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-16979">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span> told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16951">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-16992">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-17014">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-16980">brakes</span> on
"properly" before <span class="marked id-unique-16944">going</span> to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17008">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-16940">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span>, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16977">Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-16980">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-17029">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-17020">see</span> the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-16978">destroyed</span>,

<span class="marked id-unique-17021">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17022">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16977">Harper</span> said in a <span class="marked id-unique-17000">statement</span>: "Our

and <span class="marked id-unique-16981">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-16968">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16983">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-16963">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span>

of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-16999">take</span> care if using
river <span class="marked id-unique-17018">water</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-16956">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16958">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-16955">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16952">quality</span>
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-17005">added</span>.

The train was carrying the <span class="marked id-unique-16976">crude</span> oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-16974">500</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span>) of <span class="marked id-unique-17019">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16950">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-16965">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly <span class="marked id-unique-17009">24</span> hours after a runaway train carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-16976">crude</span> oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that <span class="marked id-unique-16978">destroyed</span> a town's center and killed at
least <span class="marked id-unique-17006">one</span> person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-16961">expected</span> the death <span class="marked id-unique-17027">toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-16995">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-16987">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-16975">155</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span>
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-17003">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 <span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span>
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-16932">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-17024">confirmed</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-17006">one</span> person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-16953">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-17015">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span>.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-16989">Guy</span> Lapointe, a <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span> with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-17028">number</span>.

"People are calling in <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> love ones <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span>, some
people are <span class="marked id-unique-17017">reported</span> two, three <span class="marked id-unique-16935">times</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17026">missing</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-16942">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16939">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-16991">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local <span class="marked id-unique-17010">time</span>. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-17020">see</span> the center of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-16978">destroyed</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-16947">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17011">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-16971">asking</span> ourselves how we
are <span class="marked id-unique-16944">going</span> to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-16962">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-16964">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16986">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-16994">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16984">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-16936">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-16970">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-16951">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
<span class="marked id-unique-16979">company</span> of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-16980">brakes</span> aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-16944">going</span>
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-16992">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-16980">brakes</span> were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-17014">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-17025">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-16933">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous <span class="marked id-unique-17030">crash</span> and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-17033">early</span> morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-16985">patio</span> at the
<span class="marked id-unique-17010">time</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-17030">crash</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-16945">feared</span> for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-16988">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-17013">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-16982">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-17007">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-16941">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-16937">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-16957">live</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-16946">Firefighters</span>, including some from Maine, doused the <span class="marked id-unique-17031">blaze</span>
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as <span class="marked id-unique-17006">one</span> akin to a war zone.

<span class="marked id-unique-17016">Dozens</span> of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many <span class="marked id-unique-16945">feared</span> the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 <span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span>) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-16996">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-16933">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-16967">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a <span class="marked id-unique-17029">fireball</span>," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-16963">Environment</span> Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16966">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17032">Blanchette</span> said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-16940">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-16983">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. <span class="marked id-unique-17032">Blanchette</span> said the
<span class="marked id-unique-16973">73</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-17008">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-16976">crude</span> oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-16990">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-16993">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-16999">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-17018">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-17005">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-16956">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16958">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-16955">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-16952">quality</span> of the air.

<span class="marked id-unique-16946">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

<span class="marked id-unique-16946">Firefighters</span> from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a <span class="marked id-unique-16997">spokesman</span> at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-17021">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17022">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-16977">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-17000">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-16998">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17001">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16959">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-16960">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-17023">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-16972">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-16954">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16949">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-16981">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-16977">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-16938">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the <span class="marked id-unique-16979">company</span> owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-16974">500</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16931">miles</span> (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-17019">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-16950">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-17002">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17004">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-16943">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span>
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-16948">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-16968">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-16932">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-17012">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-16934">cars</span> carrying
<span class="marked id-unique-16976">crude</span> oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-16969">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to <span class="marked id-unique-21943">rise</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-21963">Deaths</span> feared in '<span class="marked id-unique-21888">major</span> catastrophe' <span class="marked id-unique-21861">Watch</span> Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-21988">Bridge</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21913">collapses</span> after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-21951">light</span> crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
<span class="marked id-unique-21894">killing</span> one and <span class="marked id-unique-21955">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21983">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about <span class="marked id-unique-21934">250km</span>
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They <span class="marked id-unique-21895">include</span> a bar full of <span class="marked id-unique-21908">customers</span>. Police are <span class="marked id-unique-21865">trying</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-21930">account</span> for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-21975">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21941">uncoupled</span> from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-21960">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been <span class="marked id-unique-21896">immobilised</span>
in a <span class="marked id-unique-21947">neighbouring</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21971">village</span> before a <span class="marked id-unique-21876">scheduled</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21909">crew</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21966">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-21940">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21878">reason</span> had then started rolling <span class="marked id-unique-21961">downhill</span>
into Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-21957">Eyewitnesses</span> said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-21976">reached</span> the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-21942">travelling</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-21912">considerable</span> speed.

'Like a movie' The <span class="marked id-unique-21875">search</span> for more <span class="marked id-unique-21922">bodies</span> is expected to
<span class="marked id-unique-21964">continue</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-21906">dawn</span>.

Local <span class="marked id-unique-21887">media</span> have reported up to <span class="marked id-unique-21937">100</span> people missing.


"We have <span class="marked id-unique-21928">already</span> confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be <span class="marked id-unique-21898">greater</span> than the <span class="marked id-unique-21901">final</span> death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-21972">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-21986">different</span> family <span class="marked id-unique-21978">members</span>.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-21970">120</span> firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-21956">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
<span class="marked id-unique-21927">assisting</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21957">Eyewitnesses</span> reported that the town <span class="marked id-unique-21916">centre - where</span> there
are a number of <span class="marked id-unique-21924">bars - was</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21987">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "<span class="marked id-unique-21914">chaos</span>" <span class="marked id-unique-21903">ensued</span>.


Firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-21900">fought</span> the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-21949">lucky</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21984">escape</span> and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, <span class="marked id-unique-21944">quoted</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-21967">Associated</span>
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-21969">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-21974">scripted -
but</span> this was live."

A <span class="marked id-unique-21860">woman</span> described how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-21938">wagons</span>.

"There were some <span class="marked id-unique-21869">sparks</span>, and the car <span class="marked id-unique-21890">lifted</span> and came to
<span class="marked id-unique-21891">lie</span> on its <span class="marked id-unique-21870">side</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-21899">front</span> of me, but I <span class="marked id-unique-21864">turned</span> around and
<span class="marked id-unique-21879">ran</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21990">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21868">stopping</span>," she told the CBC <span class="marked id-unique-21863">TV</span>.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
<span class="marked id-unique-21904">engines</span> and 73 cars filled with <span class="marked id-unique-21951">light</span> crude oil, and

Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying <span class="marked id-unique-21951">light</span> crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
<span class="marked id-unique-21894">killing</span> one and <span class="marked id-unique-21955">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-21983">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about <span class="marked id-unique-21934">250km</span>
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They <span class="marked id-unique-21895">include</span> a bar full of <span class="marked id-unique-21908">customers</span>. Police are <span class="marked id-unique-21865">trying</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-21930">account</span> for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-21975">reportedly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21941">uncoupled</span> from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-21960">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been <span class="marked id-unique-21896">immobilised</span>
in a <span class="marked id-unique-21947">neighbouring</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21971">village</span> before a <span class="marked id-unique-21876">scheduled</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21909">crew</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21966">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-21940">unknown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21878">reason</span> had then started rolling <span class="marked id-unique-21961">downhill</span>
into Lac-Megantic.

<span class="marked id-unique-21957">Eyewitnesses</span> said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-21976">reached</span> the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-21942">travelling</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-21912">considerable</span> speed.

'Like a movie' The <span class="marked id-unique-21875">search</span> for more <span class="marked id-unique-21922">bodies</span> is expected to
<span class="marked id-unique-21964">continue</span> at <span class="marked id-unique-21906">dawn</span>.

Local <span class="marked id-unique-21887">media</span> have reported up to <span class="marked id-unique-21937">100</span> people missing.


"We have <span class="marked id-unique-21928">already</span> confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be <span class="marked id-unique-21898">greater</span> than the <span class="marked id-unique-21901">final</span> death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-21972">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-21986">different</span> family <span class="marked id-unique-21978">members</span>.

Some <span class="marked id-unique-21970">120</span> firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-21956">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
<span class="marked id-unique-21927">assisting</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-21957">Eyewitnesses</span> reported that the town <span class="marked id-unique-21916">centre - where</span> there
are a number of <span class="marked id-unique-21924">bars - was</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21987">crowded</span> at the time of the
blast, and that "<span class="marked id-unique-21914">chaos</span>" <span class="marked id-unique-21903">ensued</span>.


Firefighters <span class="marked id-unique-21900">fought</span> the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was <span class="marked id-unique-21949">lucky</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-21984">escape</span> and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, <span class="marked id-unique-21944">quoted</span> by the <span class="marked id-unique-21967">Associated</span>
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-21969">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-21974">scripted -
but</span> this was live."

A <span class="marked id-unique-21860">woman</span> described how close she was to one of the <span class="marked id-unique-21938">wagons</span>.

"There were some <span class="marked id-unique-21869">sparks</span>, and the car <span class="marked id-unique-21890">lifted</span> and came to
<span class="marked id-unique-21891">lie</span> on its <span class="marked id-unique-21870">side</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-21899">front</span> of me, but I <span class="marked id-unique-21864">turned</span> around and
<span class="marked id-unique-21879">ran</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21990">without</span> <span class="marked id-unique-21868">stopping</span>," she told the CBC <span class="marked id-unique-21863">TV</span>.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
<span class="marked id-unique-21904">engines</span> and 73 cars filled with <span class="marked id-unique-21951">light</span> crude oil, and

Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-22025">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast <span class="marked id-unique-22033">sent</span> a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-21999">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-22032">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-22001">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-21995">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-22021">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-22005">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22000">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-21997">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22009">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-22014">number</span> of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-22012">toll</span>."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-21993">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-22014">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-22024">described</span> how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-22030">five</span> locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-22010">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-22023">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-21992">Joe</span> McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-22017">happened</span> is shocking
and truly <span class="marked id-unique-21996">devastating</span>" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a <span class="marked id-unique-22016">massive</span> fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-22022">nearby</span> homes and <span class="marked id-unique-22003">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid <span class="marked id-unique-21998">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers <span class="marked id-unique-21994">exploding</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22027">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,

several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-21999">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death <span class="marked id-unique-22012">toll</span> would likely <span class="marked id-unique-21991">rise</span>.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22009">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-22025">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-21998">fears</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-22030">five</span> of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-21993">fighting</span> multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-22030">five</span> tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
<span class="marked id-unique-21994">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-22017">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-22022">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-22010">Edward</span> Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-22020">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-22023">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-21992">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-22005">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22000">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-21995">engine</span> was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22015">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22019">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-22024">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
<span class="marked id-unique-22016">massive</span> balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-22021">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-22004">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-22014">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-22026">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-21997">reached</span> by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-22013">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-22006">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-22022">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22031">Chaudiere</span> River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-22008">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22011">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22007">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-22001">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

<span class="marked id-unique-22034">Deaths</span> feared in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-22064">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-22044">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-22102">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-22087">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-22113">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-22072">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-22095">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-22039">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-22099">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-22074">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-22107">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-22111">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-22112">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-22051">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22081">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-22036">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-22043">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22083">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22040">members</span>.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-22062">continued</span> for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-22077">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-22100">Musi-Cafe</span>
at the time, said he was lucky to <span class="marked id-unique-22042">escape</span> and feared for
those <span class="marked id-unique-22080">inside</span> the bar.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-22107">movie</span>," he said, quoted by the <span class="marked id-unique-22035">Associated</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22092">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-22038">scripted -
but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-22055">live</span>."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-22066">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-22088">around</span> and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-22046">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-22070">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-22110">filled</span> with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-22082">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-22049">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-22084">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-22101">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars <span class="marked id-unique-22110">filled</span> with <span class="marked id-unique-22041">fuel</span> somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22105">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-22045">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22098">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-22068">asking</span> ourselves how we

<span class="marked id-unique-22106">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22108">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-22091">statement</span>: "Our

and <span class="marked id-unique-22073">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-22065">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22075">spilled</span> into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said <span class="marked id-unique-22060">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman
<span class="marked id-unique-22063">Christian</span> Blanchette, adding that communities <span class="marked id-unique-22085">downstream</span>
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-22090">take</span> care if using
river <span class="marked id-unique-22103">water</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-22054">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22056">laboratory</span> had been set up to <span class="marked id-unique-22053">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-22050">quality</span>
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-22097">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-22071">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-22104">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22048">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,

Quebec Police: More Oil Train <span class="marked id-unique-22034">Deaths</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22111">Expected</span>

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-22062">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-22111">expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-22087">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-22079">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-22072">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-22095">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-22112">confirmed</span> that
one person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-22051">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-22102">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22081">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three <span class="marked id-unique-22036">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-22043">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22040">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-22083">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22105">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-22045">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22098">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-22068">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-22059">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-22061">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22078">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22086">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22076">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-22037">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-22067">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-22049">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-22084">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-22101">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-22113">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-22077">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-22080">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-22100">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-22074">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-22107">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-22042">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-22038">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-22055">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-22088">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-22064">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-22060">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22063">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-22041">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-22075">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-22070">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-22110">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-22082">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-22085">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-22090">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-22103">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-22097">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-22054">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22056">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-22053">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-22050">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-22106">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22108">Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-22091">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-22089">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22093">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22057">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-22058">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-22109">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-22069">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-22052">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22047">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-22073">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-22039">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22071">500</span> miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-22104">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22048">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-22094">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22096">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-22044">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-22046">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-22065">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-22099">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-22066">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail <span class="marked id-unique-22134">crash</span>
Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-22128">exploded</span>
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) <span class="marked id-unique-22133">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-22122">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started <span class="marked id-unique-22119">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news <span class="marked id-unique-22115">agency</span>. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the <span class="marked id-unique-22124">CBC</span> TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five <span class="marked id-unique-22138">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-22127">four</span>
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an <span class="marked id-unique-22116">overnight</span> driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by <span class="marked id-unique-22124">CBC</span>,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-22132">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, <span class="marked id-unique-22117">half</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-22114">mile</span> (800m) away."

Some of the cars <span class="marked id-unique-22128">exploded</span>, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news <span class="marked id-unique-22125">briefing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-22136">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22137">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-22130">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-22129">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22131">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22121">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-22123">families</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22139">friends</span> of

and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-22135">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-22122">full</span> of crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-22128">exploded</span>
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles <span class="marked id-unique-22133">east</span>
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the <span class="marked id-unique-22134">crash</span> site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
<span class="marked id-unique-22125">briefing</span>, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in Lac
Megantic early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and <span class="marked id-unique-22128">exploded</span> in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the <span class="marked id-unique-22138">locomotive</span>.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday afternoon that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train got loose,' said McGonigle. ... The <span class="marked id-unique-22138">locomotive</span>
portion of the 73-car train actually detached <span class="marked id-unique-22117">half</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-22114">mile</span> outside of the small town, he <span class="marked id-unique-22135">added</span>, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on <span class="marked id-unique-22119">rolling</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-22124">CBC</span> News says
that "witnesses reported between <span class="marked id-unique-22127">four</span> and six explosions
<span class="marked id-unique-22116">overnight</span> in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-22132">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one person has died in the accident, <span class="marked id-unique-22124">CBC</span> News

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-22194">dead</span>
after a <span class="marked id-unique-22191">runaway</span> train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the <span class="marked id-unique-22195">air</span>,
killing one and <span class="marked id-unique-22145">forcing</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-22154">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-22173">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-22187">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-22165">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a <span class="marked id-unique-22144">neighbouring</span> village before a scheduled crew <span class="marked id-unique-22148">change</span>,
but for an <span class="marked id-unique-22142">unknown</span> reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the <span class="marked id-unique-22168">driverless</span> train
reached the town it was <span class="marked id-unique-22143">travelling</span> at considerable <span class="marked id-unique-22158">speed</span>.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a <span class="marked id-unique-22168">driverless</span> freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-22158">speed</span>,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-22194">dead</span>, after the
<span class="marked id-unique-22191">runaway</span> train with <span class="marked id-unique-22172">73</span> carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

<span class="marked id-unique-22179">Four</span> of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
<span class="marked id-unique-22174">subsequent</span> explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was <span class="marked id-unique-22156">crowded</span> at the
time. About 6,000 people <span class="marked id-unique-22163">live</span> in the <span class="marked id-unique-22178">lakeside</span> town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about <span class="marked id-unique-22173">155</span> miles <span class="marked id-unique-22187">east</span>
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile <span class="marked id-unique-22146">exclusion</span> zone as <span class="marked id-unique-22150">120</span>
firefighters battled to control the blaze, <span class="marked id-unique-22145">forcing</span> the
<span class="marked id-unique-22154">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on <span class="marked id-unique-22149">amid</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22153">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-22177">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22180">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22176">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He <span class="marked id-unique-22190">added</span>: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-22198">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, <span class="marked id-unique-22157">you'll</span> understand that we're <span class="marked id-unique-22171">asking</span> ourselves
how we are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-22166">event</span>."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial <span class="marked id-unique-22183">statement</span>, posting: "<span class="marked id-unique-22181">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-22184">prayers</span> are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-22197">track</span> in Maine and
<span class="marked id-unique-22196">Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22185">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22188">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was <span class="marked id-unique-22142">unknown</span> how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an <span class="marked id-unique-22151">overnight</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22155">driver</span> shift <span class="marked id-unique-22148">change</span>.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-22186">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-22192">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. <span class="marked id-unique-22159">Somehow</span> the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-22165">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train <span class="marked id-unique-22143">travelling</span> that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the <span class="marked id-unique-22140">wagons</span> come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-22193">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's <span class="marked id-unique-22170">cargo</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22175">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

<span class="marked id-unique-22167">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22169">Christian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22189">Blanchette</span> said
<span class="marked id-unique-22147">communities</span> downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of <span class="marked id-unique-22141">using</span> river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the <span class="marked id-unique-22195">air</span>, so we
have a <span class="marked id-unique-22162">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22164">laboratory</span> here to <span class="marked id-unique-22161">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-22160">quality</span> of
the <span class="marked id-unique-22195">air</span>.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-22182">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
<span class="marked id-unique-22144">neighbouring</span> municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-22196">Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern <span class="marked id-unique-22152">half</span> of Canada.

<span class="marked id-unique-22243">Dozens</span> of buildings were <span class="marked id-unique-22245">destroyed</span> in the town, about 250km

those <span class="marked id-unique-22241">inside</span> the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
<span class="marked id-unique-22224">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the <span class="marked id-unique-22214">car</span> lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran <span class="marked id-unique-22205">without</span> stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-22211">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22210">locomotive</span>
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the <span class="marked id-unique-22220">village</span> of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight <span class="marked id-unique-22203">driver</span>
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The <span class="marked id-unique-22208">railway's</span> chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-22219">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-22251">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a <span class="marked id-unique-22246">local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22200">hotel</span> for the night.

The cars filled with fuel <span class="marked id-unique-22234">somehow</span> became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-22247">happened</span> is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive <span class="marked id-unique-22248">fireball</span>
and setting fire to nearby homes and <span class="marked id-unique-22237">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion <span class="marked id-unique-22239">zone</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-22250">set</span> up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost <span class="marked id-unique-22245">destroyed</span>,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to <span class="marked id-unique-22235">get</span> through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a <span class="marked id-unique-22223">statement</span>: "Our
<span class="marked id-unique-22221">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22225">prayers</span> go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and <span class="marked id-unique-22215">subsequent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22242">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-22222">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been <span class="marked id-unique-22250">set</span> up to monitor the quality
of the air, he <span class="marked id-unique-22230">added</span>.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track <span class="marked id-unique-22206">serving</span> Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22226">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22229">Brunswick</span>.

A <span class="marked id-unique-22217">lakeside</span> town that is home to some 6,000 people,

One <span class="marked id-unique-22252">dead</span>, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-22252">dead</span> after a <span class="marked id-unique-22236">driverless</span>
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high <span class="marked id-unique-22233">speed</span>
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the <span class="marked id-unique-22236">driverless</span>
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-22207">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque <span class="marked id-unique-22217">lakeside</span> town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the <span class="marked id-unique-22240">patio</span>.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and <span class="marked id-unique-22209">others</span> on the
<span class="marked id-unique-22240">patio</span> fled. They were <span class="marked id-unique-22199">lucky</span>.  On Saturday afternoon police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
<span class="marked id-unique-22215">subsequent</span> explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22218">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found deceased." The <span class="marked id-unique-22248">fireball</span> and
shock wave from the explosion <span class="marked id-unique-22245">destroyed</span> 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-22237">businesses</span> and left <span class="marked id-unique-22243">dozens</span> of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, <span class="marked id-unique-22227">east</span> of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those <span class="marked id-unique-22241">inside</span> the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-22211">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
<span class="marked id-unique-22204">crowded</span> when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-22222">take</span> cover behind his <span class="marked id-unique-22214">car</span> to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
<span class="marked id-unique-22242">fires</span>, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the <span class="marked id-unique-22208">railway's</span> operator,
the derailed train was a <span class="marked id-unique-22231">runaway</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-22219">Edward</span> Burkhardt, chief
executive of Rail World, the parent company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car train was parked
uphill of Lac-Megantic after the <span class="marked id-unique-22251">engineer</span> had finished
his run. <span class="marked id-unique-22234">Somehow</span> it headed into town <span class="marked id-unique-22205">without</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-22203">driver</span>.
"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were properly applied on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war <span class="marked id-unique-22239">zone</span>: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-22232">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track <span class="marked id-unique-22206">serving</span> Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-22226">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22229">Brunswick</span>, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-22200">hotel</span> for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-22250">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-22247">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-22251">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... <span class="marked id-unique-22234">somehow</span>,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-22247">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-22228">Canada</span> is looking
for the <span class="marked id-unique-22244">black</span> box to confirm the direction and <span class="marked id-unique-22233">speed</span> of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
photos and videos from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a <span class="marked id-unique-22249">blaze</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-22216">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a <span class="marked id-unique-22210">locomotive</span> fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke <span class="marked id-unique-22212">continued</span> to fill
the sky Saturday afternoon.  "We can still see a lot of
<span class="marked id-unique-22244">black</span> smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-22237">businesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22245">destroyed</span>, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-22250">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-22238">Early</span> this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a <span class="marked id-unique-22213">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small <span class="marked id-unique-22220">village</span>, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A Facebook group
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-22250">set</span> up to help people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-22202">reached</span> by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a <span class="marked id-unique-22246">local</span> school, where 20 volunteers from the Red Cross
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them <span class="marked id-unique-22235">get</span>
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red Cross
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will <span class="marked id-unique-22201">continue</span> to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “<span class="marked id-unique-22221">Thoughts</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-22225">prayers</span> are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a <span class="marked id-unique-22223">statement</span> later, the prime minister <span class="marked id-unique-22230">added</span>: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any assistance requested by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown Friday night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular <span class="marked id-unique-22246">local</span> singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been <span class="marked id-unique-22241">inside</span>
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-22224">Press</span>

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic death toll set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major <span class="marked id-unique-22282">catastrophe'</span> Watch Explosion after
US train derailment <span class="marked id-unique-22261">Bridge</span> collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-22319">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and <span class="marked id-unique-22305">black</span> smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-22329">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(<span class="marked id-unique-22290">155</span> miles) <span class="marked id-unique-22312">east</span> of Montreal.

They include a <span class="marked id-unique-22331">bar</span> full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars <span class="marked id-unique-22256">reportedly</span> uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-22316">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-22292">started</span> rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a <span class="marked id-unique-22324">movie'</span> The search for more bodies is <span class="marked id-unique-22276">expected</span> to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already <span class="marked id-unique-22328">confirmed</span> one death and we expect there
will be <span class="marked id-unique-22268">others</span>," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22299">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
<span class="marked id-unique-22253">times</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-22260">different</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22301">family</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22257">members</span>.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has <span class="marked id-unique-22280">continued</span> for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the <span class="marked id-unique-22330">border</span> in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.

Bernard Theberge, who was on the <span class="marked id-unique-22295">patio</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-22317">Musi-Cafe</span>

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and <span class="marked id-unique-22288">73</span> cars <span class="marked id-unique-22327">filled</span> with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (<span class="marked id-unique-22300">four</span>

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires <span class="marked id-unique-22280">continued</span> burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in eastern Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
least one person. Police said they <span class="marked id-unique-22276">expected</span> the death toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-22305">black</span> smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
<span class="marked id-unique-22297">lakeside</span> town of 6,000 people, which is about <span class="marked id-unique-22290">155</span> miles
(250 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-22312">east</span> of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine <span class="marked id-unique-22330">border</span>.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet <span class="marked id-unique-22328">confirmed</span> that
one person had died. He refused to say how many <span class="marked id-unique-22268">others</span>
might be <span class="marked id-unique-22319">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22299">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three <span class="marked id-unique-22253">times</span> missing by <span class="marked id-unique-22260">different</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22257">members</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-22301">family</span>," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22322">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
<span class="marked id-unique-22262">you'll</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22315">understand</span> that we're <span class="marked id-unique-22286">asking</span> ourselves how we
are going to get through this <span class="marked id-unique-22277">event</span>," an <span class="marked id-unique-22279">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22296">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22304">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22294">Roy-Laroche</span> told a <span class="marked id-unique-22254">televised</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-22285">briefing</span>.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the <span class="marked id-unique-22266">railway's</span> operator said.

The president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes aren't properly applied on a train, it's going
to run away," said <span class="marked id-unique-22302">Edward</span> Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were properly applied on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-22318">engineer</span> had finished his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-22329">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-22331">bar</span> were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's <span class="marked id-unique-22295">patio</span> at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those <span class="marked id-unique-22298">inside</span>
the popular <span class="marked id-unique-22317">Musi-Cafe</span> when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-22292">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a <span class="marked id-unique-22324">movie</span>," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to <span class="marked id-unique-22259">escape</span> with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were <span class="marked id-unique-22255">scripted - but</span> this was <span class="marked id-unique-22272">live</span>."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief Denis Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-22306">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the <span class="marked id-unique-22331">bar</span>, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a <span class="marked id-unique-22282">catastrophe</span>. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-22278">Environment</span> Quebec spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22281">Christian</span> Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of <span class="marked id-unique-22258">fuel</span> had also <span class="marked id-unique-22293">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
<span class="marked id-unique-22288">73</span> cars were <span class="marked id-unique-22327">filled</span> with crude oil, and at least <span class="marked id-unique-22300">four</span> were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
<span class="marked id-unique-22303">downstream</span> to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-22308">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-22320">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

He <span class="marked id-unique-22314">added</span> that a <span class="marked id-unique-22271">mobile</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22273">laboratory</span> had been set up to
<span class="marked id-unique-22270">monitor</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-22267">quality</span> of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-22323">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22325">Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a <span class="marked id-unique-22309">statement</span>.

"Our <span class="marked id-unique-22307">thoughts</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22310">prayers</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22274">go</span> out to the <span class="marked id-unique-22275">families</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-22326">friends</span> of those <span class="marked id-unique-22287">affected</span> by this <span class="marked id-unique-22269">morning's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22264">tragic</span> train
derailment and <span class="marked id-unique-22291">subsequent</span> fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, <span class="marked id-unique-22256">reportedly</span> heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22289">500</span> miles (800
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-22321">track</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22265">serving</span> Maine, Vermont, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-22311">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22313">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged <span class="marked id-unique-22261">bridge</span> sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed <span class="marked id-unique-22263">without</span> spilling their <span class="marked id-unique-22283">cargo</span>.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
<span class="marked id-unique-22330">border</span>. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-22316">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
<span class="marked id-unique-22284">car</span> holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.
