Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by <span class="marked id-unique-733">train derailment</span>

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a <span class="marked id-unique-733">train derailment</span> in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-736">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-734">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-737">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-733">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-738">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many <span class="marked id-unique-740">homes
and businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a <span class="marked id-unique-741">train
<span class="marked id-unique-738">carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-735">crude</span> oil</span> is still burning in the eastern Quebec

Smoke rises from railway cars that were <span class="marked id-unique-738">carrying <span class="marked id-unique-735">crude</span>
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-742">evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-743">000</span> people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-745">police said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-744">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-746">people who will be found</span> deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-747">Guy Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-749">people <span class="marked id-unique-750">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-751">missing</span>
than people</span> actually <span class="marked id-unique-753">found dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-756">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-757">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of <span class="marked id-unique-756">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-757">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, Edward Burkhardt
<span class="marked id-unique-758">said the train</span> was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-760">brakes were properly</span>
applied on this train." He <span class="marked id-unique-758">said the train</span> was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-752">Joe McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-756">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-757">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-758">said the
train</span> "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-731">started rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-745">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-759">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-761">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-754">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-762">New</span> Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-743">000 people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-739">number of
people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-735">crude oil</span> <span class="marked id-unique-763">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-748">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-755">Chaudiere</span> River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-764">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-765">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-744">death toll</span> set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US <span class="marked id-unique-733">train derailment</span> Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-745">Police have said</span> they expect more <span class="marked id-unique-746">people to be <span class="marked id-unique-753">found</span> dead</span>
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-741">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-735">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-732">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-742">evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-743">000</span> people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-751">missing people</span>.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials <span class="marked id-unique-758">said the train</span> had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-731">started rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-747">Guy Lapointe</span>.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-739">number of <span class="marked id-unique-749">people</span> <span class="marked id-unique-750">reported</span> missing</span>
will be greater than the final <span class="marked id-unique-744">death toll</span>."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-749">people had been <span class="marked id-unique-750">reported</span> missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-756">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-757">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light <span class="marked id-unique-735">crude oil</span>, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-760">brakes on
"properly</span>" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-752">Joe McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-737">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby <span class="marked id-unique-740">homes and businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-764">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-765">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-736">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-734">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-737">Stephen</span> Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-733">train derailment</span>
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-763">spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-748">nearby</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-755">Chaudiere</span> river</span>, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The <span class="marked id-unique-741">train was <span class="marked id-unique-738">carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-735">crude</span> oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. <span class="marked id-unique-756">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-757">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-759">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-761">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-754">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-762">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,<span class="marked id-unique-743">000 people</span>,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

The <span class="marked id-unique-1220">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-1222">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1217">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1223">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,

explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-1221">killed at <span class="marked id-unique-1224">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1226">one</span> person</span>.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-1225">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-1228">30
buildings</span> and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

that the <span class="marked id-unique-1237">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do <span class="marked id-unique-1240">expect
<span class="marked id-unique-1241">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-1242">people</span> who will be <span class="marked id-unique-1243">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1244">deceased</span>,
unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-1245">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-1246">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down

for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-1235">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-1261">fire <span class="marked id-unique-1251">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1234">Denis</span> Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-1262">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-1263">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-1264">Atlantic</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-1274">said the <span class="marked id-unique-1275">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-1276">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1230">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-1260">brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-1256">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1278">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1279">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-1280">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-1257">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-1281">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1267">away</span>," he said</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-1216">think the <span class="marked id-unique-1283">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-1278">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1279">applied</span> on this train</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-1274">said the <span class="marked id-unique-1275">train</span> was parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-1255">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-1282">finished</span> his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-1284">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-1275">train</span> was parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-1262">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-1263">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1274">said the
train</span> "came loose" in the <span class="marked id-unique-1229">early morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-1239">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-1277">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-1285">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-1258">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-1286">New</span> Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone <span class="marked id-unique-1287">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-1273">described</span> the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-1288">popular area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-1236">000 people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-1227">number of
people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-1215">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-1219">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-1259">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-1289">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-1290">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-1231">train <span class="marked id-unique-1225">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1219">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-1232">eastern Quebec</span>, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-1221">killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-1224">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1226">one</span> person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-1239">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-1237">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-1220">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-1284">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a <span class="marked id-unique-1261">fire chief</span> likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-1236">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-1215">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-1236">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-1238">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-1218">provincial</span> police</span> Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-1226">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-1253">many"
<span class="marked id-unique-1247">people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-1248">reported</span> missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-1245">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-1246">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-1238">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-1218">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1239">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-1240">expect <span class="marked id-unique-1241">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-1242">people</span> who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-1243">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1244">deceased</span> unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-1252">give any estimate</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1254">people unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-1227">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-1250">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-1247">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-1288">popular area</span> packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-1239">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-1289">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-1290">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-1265">president and <span class="marked id-unique-1266">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1268">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1269">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1249">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-1270">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1271">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1262">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1263">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-1264">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1274">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-1275">train</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-1276">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1230">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-1260">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-1256">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1278">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1279">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-1280">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-1257">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-1281">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1267">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1272">Edward Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-1216">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-1283">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-1278">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1279">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-1274">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-1275">train</span> was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-1255">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-1282">finished</span> his run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-1228">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-1229">early morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local <span class="marked id-unique-1261">fire <span class="marked id-unique-1251">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1234">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1287">Lauzon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1273">described</span> the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-1273">described the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-1219">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-1259">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-1213">Quebec town</span>, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-1222">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1217">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1223">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-1214">train
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-1235">assistance
requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-1262">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-1263">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-1277">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-1285">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1258">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-1286">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-1231">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-1233">cars <span class="marked id-unique-1225">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1219">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-1262">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-1263">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-1264">Atlantic</span> Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-1306">CTV News</span> Saturday

massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-1302">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of

explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down

The Red Cross had set up a shelter <span class="marked id-unique-1309">Saturday afternoon</span> to

some <span class="marked id-unique-1296">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Inferno In <span class="marked id-unique-1291">Quebec Town</span> When Train Explodes

At <span class="marked id-unique-1299">least <span class="marked id-unique-1300">one</span> person</span> has died, <span class="marked id-unique-1306">CTV News</span> reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-1296">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small <span class="marked id-unique-1291">Quebec town</span> about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, <span class="marked id-unique-1306">CTV News</span> says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in <span class="marked id-unique-1292">Lac
Megantic</span> early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
<span class="marked id-unique-1309">Saturday afternoon</span> that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail <span class="marked id-unique-1301">cars carrying</span>
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-1296">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the <span class="marked id-unique-1305">train got</span> loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-1307">73-car train</span> actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the <span class="marked id-unique-1301">cars
carrying</span> the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-1308">witnesses reported</span> between four and six explosions
overnight in the <span class="marked id-unique-1294">town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-1302">000</span> people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 <span class="marked id-unique-1303">people have been <span class="marked id-unique-1304">reported</span> missing</span>."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say <span class="marked id-unique-1300">one person</span> has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-1297">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1295">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1298">Stephen</span> Harper</span>
has issued a statement:

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-1293">train
derailment</span>. We hope evacuees can return to their homes
safely and quickly."

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-1313">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1310">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1314">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-1315">30
buildings</span> and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-1317">evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-1318">000</span> people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul

that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-1323">hours before the derailment</span>.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-1324">Montreal Maine</span> & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of <span class="marked id-unique-1324">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-1327">train got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-1324">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-1319">Police said</span> it's too early

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight <span class="marked id-unique-1316">train carrying</span>
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-1312">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-1318">000 people</span> live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About <span class="marked id-unique-1315">30 buildings</span> in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents <span class="marked id-unique-1320">reported hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 <span class="marked id-unique-1323">hours after the derailment</span>.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-1317">evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-1318">000</span> people</span>.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-1319">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-1330">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-1331">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1311">Roy-Laroche</span> said</span>: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-1313">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1310">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1314">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by <span class="marked id-unique-1324">Montreal, Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-1326">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in <span class="marked id-unique-1321">Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-1329">New</span>
Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the <span class="marked id-unique-1327">train got</span> released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-1325">described the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-1322">Chaudiere
River</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-1322">Chaudiere River</span>."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-1326">Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-1328">Vermont</span>. Quebec</span> is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
<span class="marked id-unique-1343">One person</span> has been declared dead after a driverless
freight <span class="marked id-unique-1348">train carrying</span> oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of <span class="marked id-unique-1332">town.

<span class="marked id-unique-1337">LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, QUE</span>.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-1340">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-1395">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of <span class="marked id-unique-1343">one <span class="marked id-unique-1344">person</span> in the derailment</span> and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, <span class="marked id-unique-1359">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-1360">Guy</span> Lapointe</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-1352">Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-1339">provincial</span> police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-1357">people <span class="marked id-unique-1358">found</span> deceased</span>." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-1345">30 buildings</span> and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-1334">town
of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-1351">000</span> people</span>, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-1361">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-1377">Edward Burkhardt</span>, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-1374">Rail World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-1375">parent <span class="marked id-unique-1376">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1370">Montreal</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-1371">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-1372">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, said the <span class="marked id-unique-1390">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-1379">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-1380">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1347">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-1362">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-1387">finished</span>
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-1369">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-1363">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1383">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1384">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-1385">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-1365">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-1386">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1373">away</span>," said</span> Burkhardt. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-1335">think the <span class="marked id-unique-1389">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-1383">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1384">applied</span> on this train</span>." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-1333">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-1378">owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-1349">800</span> kilometres</span> of
track serving <span class="marked id-unique-1368">Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-1392">New</span> Brunswick</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1381">Maine and Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
<span class="marked id-unique-1382">train got</span> loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-1382">train got</span> released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the <span class="marked id-unique-1339">provincial <span class="marked id-unique-1353">police</span> said</span> they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-1338">Lapointe said</span>
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-1394">photos and videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-1338">Lapointe
<span class="marked id-unique-1354">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1355">Saturday</span> night</span>.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-1395">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
<span class="marked id-unique-1339">provincial police</span> Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "<span class="marked id-unique-1346">Early this morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-1356">Facebook group</span>
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-1393">set up to help</span> people track down loved ones
who couldn't be <span class="marked id-unique-1367">reached by phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-1364">Red Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-1364">Red Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-1366">firefighters on the scene</span> and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-1341">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1336">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1342">Stephen</span> Harper</span>, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-1341">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-1350">assistance requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-1391">Friday night</span>.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she <span class="marked id-unique-1388">said. “When you think</span> of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

The <span class="marked id-unique-1403">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-1405">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1400">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1406">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,

caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-1397">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-1404">killed at <span class="marked id-unique-1407">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1409">one</span> person</span>.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-1408">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-1411">30
buildings</span> and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a <span class="marked id-unique-1414">train
<span class="marked id-unique-1408">carrying</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1402">crude</span> oil</span> is still burning in the <span class="marked id-unique-1415">eastern <span class="marked id-unique-1396">Quebec</span>

oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,

several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-1419">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) <span class="marked id-unique-1421">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-1401">provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1422">police</span> said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-1420">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do <span class="marked id-unique-1423">expect
<span class="marked id-unique-1424">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-1425">people</span> who will be <span class="marked id-unique-1426">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1427">deceased</span>,
unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-1428">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-1429">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-1430">people <span class="marked id-unique-1431">reported</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1433">missing</span>
than people</span> actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-1435">give an estimate</span> to how <span class="marked id-unique-1436">many <span class="marked id-unique-1437">people</span> were unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-1418">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-1444">fire <span class="marked id-unique-1434">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1417">Denis</span> Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-1445">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-1446">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-1447">Atlantic</span>
Railway</span> Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-1448">President and <span class="marked id-unique-1449">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1451">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1452">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1432">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-1453">parent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1454">company</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-1457">said the <span class="marked id-unique-1458">train</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-1459">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1413">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-1443">brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-1439">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1461">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1462">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-1463">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-1440">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-1464">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1450">away</span>," he said</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-1399">think the <span class="marked id-unique-1466">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-1461">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1462">applied</span> on this train</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-1457">said the <span class="marked id-unique-1458">train</span> was parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-1438">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-1465">finished</span> his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-1467">73-car <span class="marked id-unique-1458">train</span> was parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-1445">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-1446">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1457">said the
train</span> "came loose" in the <span class="marked id-unique-1412">early morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-1422">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-1460">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-1468">Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-1441">Quebec</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-1469">New</span> Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone <span class="marked id-unique-1470">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-1456">described</span> the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-1471">popular area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-1419">000 people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-1410">number of
people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-1398">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-1402">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-1442">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-1472">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-1473">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

          <div class="ref"><p class="info-text">Reference (train-ap-org):</p><pre>
LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-1414">train <span class="marked id-unique-1408">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1402">crude</span> oil</span> derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-1415">eastern Quebec</span>, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-1404">killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-1407">least</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1409">one</span> person</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-1422">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-1420">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-1403">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-1467">73-car train</span> derailed, and
a <span class="marked id-unique-1444">fire chief</span> likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-1419">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-1398">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-1419">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-1421">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-1401">provincial</span> police</span> Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
<span class="marked id-unique-1409">one person</span> had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-1436">many"
<span class="marked id-unique-1430">people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-1431">reported</span> missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-1428">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-1429">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-1421">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-1401">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1422">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do <span class="marked id-unique-1423">expect <span class="marked id-unique-1424">we'll</span> have other <span class="marked id-unique-1425">people</span> who will
be <span class="marked id-unique-1426">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1427">deceased</span> unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-1435">give any estimate</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1437">people unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-1410">number.

"People</span> are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-1433">missing, some
<span class="marked id-unique-1430">people</span> are reported</span> two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-1471">popular area</span> packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-1422">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-1472">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-1473">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-1448">president and <span class="marked id-unique-1449">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1451">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1452">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1432">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-1453">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1454">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-1445">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1446">Maine</span> & <span class="marked id-unique-1447">Atlantic</span> Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1457">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-1458">train</span> had been <span class="marked id-unique-1459">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1413">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-1443">brakes <span class="marked id-unique-1439">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1461">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1462">applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-1463">train</span>, it's <span class="marked id-unique-1440">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-1464">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1450">away</span>," said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1455">Edward Burkhardt</span>. "But we <span class="marked id-unique-1399">think the
<span class="marked id-unique-1466">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-1461">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1462">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-1457">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-1458">train</span> was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-1438">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-1465">finished</span> his run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-1411">30
buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the <span class="marked id-unique-1412">early morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local <span class="marked id-unique-1444">fire <span class="marked id-unique-1434">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1417">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1470">Lauzon</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1456">described</span> the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-1456">described the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-1402">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-1442">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-1396">Quebec town</span>, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-1405">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-1400">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1406">Stephen</span> Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-1397">train
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-1418">assistance
requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-1445">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-1446">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-1460">Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-1468">Vermont</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1441">Quebec</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-1469">New</span> Brunswick</span>.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-1414">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-1416">cars <span class="marked id-unique-1408">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-1402">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-1445">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-1446">Maine</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-1447">Atlantic</span> Railway</span> carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-7622">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7623">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7625">Stephen</span> Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-7626">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were <span class="marked id-unique-7626">carrying <span class="marked id-unique-7621">crude</span>
oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-7627">evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-7628">000</span> people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-7630">police said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-7629">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-7631">people who will be found</span> deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-7632">reported missing</span>
than people actually <span class="marked id-unique-7634">found dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-7637">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-7638">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-7633">Joe McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-7637">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7638">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-7630">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-7639">Maine, Vermont</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-7635">Quebec and New</span> Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-7628">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-7621">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-7636">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-7640">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Canada train blast: Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-7629">death toll</span> set to rise

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
<span class="marked id-unique-7630">Police have said</span> they expect more <span class="marked id-unique-7631">people to be <span class="marked id-unique-7634">found</span> dead</span>
after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-7624">train carrying</span> light <span class="marked id-unique-7621">crude oil</span> exploded
in the Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-7620">town of Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-7627">evacuation of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-7628">000</span> people</span>.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people <span class="marked id-unique-7632">reported missing</span>
will be greater than the final <span class="marked id-unique-7629">death toll</span>."

He said some people had been <span class="marked id-unique-7632">reported missing</span> several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-7637">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7638">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-7633">Joe McGonigle</span>.


Canadian PM <span class="marked id-unique-7625">Stephen Harper</span>: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-7640">Colette Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-7622">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-7623">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
<span class="marked id-unique-7636">Chaudiere river</span>, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The <span class="marked id-unique-7624">train was <span class="marked id-unique-7626">carrying</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-7621">crude</span> oil</span> from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. <span class="marked id-unique-7637">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7638">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> owns more

<span class="marked id-unique-7635">Quebec and New</span> Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a <span class="marked id-unique-7965">train derailment</span> in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The <span class="marked id-unique-7969">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-7970">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-7965">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-7972">least one</span> person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-7973">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,

several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-7976">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) <span class="marked id-unique-7978">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-7979">provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7980">police</span> said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-7977">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-7981">deceased,
unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-7982">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-7983">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-7984">reported missing</span>
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how <span class="marked id-unique-7986">many people</span> were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-7985">chief Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-7990">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-7991">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.

of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
<span class="marked id-unique-7998">said the <span class="marked id-unique-7999">train</span> was parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7967">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-8001">brakes
aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8002">properly applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-8003">train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-7988">going</span> to run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-8002">properly
applied</span> on this train." He <span class="marked id-unique-7998">said the <span class="marked id-unique-7999">train</span> was parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-7987">engineer had finished</span> his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-7990">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7991">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-7980">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-8000">Maine, Vermont</span>,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone <span class="marked id-unique-8004">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-7997">described</span> the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-8005">popular area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-7976">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-7966">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-7968">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-7989">Chaudiere River</span>.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-8006">Mayor <span class="marked id-unique-8007">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-7971">train <span class="marked id-unique-7973">carrying</span>
crude</span> oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-7974">eastern Quebec</span>, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-7972">least one</span> person. <span class="marked id-unique-7980">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-7977">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-7969">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-7966">town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-7976">000</span> people</span>, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-7979">provincial police</span> Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-7986">many"
people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-7984">reported missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-7982">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-7983">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-7978">Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-7979">provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-7980">police</span>, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-7981">deceased unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-8005">popular area</span> packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-7980">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-8006">Mayor
<span class="marked id-unique-8007">Colette</span> Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-7992">president and <span class="marked id-unique-7993">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-7994">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7995">World</span> Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-7996">parent
company</span> of Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7991">Maine & Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-7998">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-7999">train</span> had been parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-7967">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-8001">brakes aren't</span> properly applied on a <span class="marked id-unique-8003">train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-7988">going</span>
to run</span> away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-8002">properly applied</span> on this train."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-7998">said the
<span class="marked id-unique-7999">train</span> was parked</span> because the <span class="marked id-unique-7987">engineer had finished</span> his run.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire <span class="marked id-unique-7985">chief Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8004">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-7997">described</span> the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with <span class="marked id-unique-7968">crude oil</span>, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-7989">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-7970">Prime Minister</span> Stephen Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-7965">train
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any assistance
requested by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-7990">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-7991">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-8000">Maine, Vermont</span>, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-7975">cars carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-7968">crude oil</span> across the state.

The Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-7991">Maine and Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes

several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-8017">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul

that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the <span class="marked id-unique-8018">train got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-8017">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter <span class="marked id-unique-8019">Saturday afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-8010">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-8011">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Inferno In <span class="marked id-unique-8015">Quebec Town</span> When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, CTV News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars full of <span class="marked id-unique-8011">crude oil</span> exploded
early Saturday in a small <span class="marked id-unique-8015">Quebec town</span> about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, CTV News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing might have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in <span class="marked id-unique-8008">Lac
Megantic</span> early Saturday morning was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
spokesperson for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
<span class="marked id-unique-8019">Saturday afternoon</span> that shortly before midnight, the
train's conductor stopped in nearby Nantes, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail <span class="marked id-unique-8016">cars carrying</span>
thousands of liters of <span class="marked id-unique-8011">crude oil</span> were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the <span class="marked id-unique-8018">train got</span> loose,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the 73-car train actually detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the <span class="marked id-unique-8016">cars
carrying</span> the oil kept right on rolling."  CBC News says
that "witnesses reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the <span class="marked id-unique-8010">town of about 6,<span class="marked id-unique-8017">000</span> people</span>. The derailment
happened at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one person has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-8012">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-8013">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8014">Stephen</span> Harper</span>

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of <span class="marked id-unique-8020">crude oil</span> derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents <span class="marked id-unique-8026">reported hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 <span class="marked id-unique-8028">hours after the derailment</span>.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-8024">evacuation of 1,000</span> people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, <span class="marked id-unique-8025">police said</span>. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-8032">Mayor Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8027">Roy-Laroche said</span>: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-8021">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-8022">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8023">Stephen</span> Harper</span> took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in <span class="marked id-unique-8031">Maine and
Vermont</span> in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-8030">described the scene</span> as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-8029">Chaudiere
River</span>.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-8029">Chaudiere River</span>."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-8031">Maine and Vermont</span>. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil tankers derailed at high speed
in the heart of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-8039">LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE</span>.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with tankers of volatile <span class="marked id-unique-8036">crude oil</span>,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire rolling towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On <span class="marked id-unique-8064">Saturday afternoon</span> police
confirmed the death of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-8044">Guy Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-8041">provincial police</span>, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more <span class="marked id-unique-8043">people found</span> deceased." The fireball and
shock wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown businesses and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this <span class="marked id-unique-8034">town
of about 6,000</span> people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
<span class="marked id-unique-8046">missing people</span>: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway tracks that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
kilometre away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of five between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
help those who hadn't fled with them.  Witnesses said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house two kilometres from downtown,
said he had to take cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway tracks, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, burning despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  Edward Burkhardt, chief
executive of <span class="marked id-unique-8051">Rail World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-8052">parent <span class="marked id-unique-8053">company</span> of Montreal</span>,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the 73-car <span class="marked id-unique-8054">train was parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8035">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-8047">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-8058">finished</span>
his run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes aren't <span class="marked id-unique-8056">properly applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-8048">going
to run</span> away," said Burkhardt. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-8056">properly <span class="marked id-unique-8057">applied</span> on this train</span>." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec officials on fatal <span class="marked id-unique-8033">train derailment</span>

The 10-year-old railway owns more than 800 kilometres of
track serving <span class="marked id-unique-8050">Quebec, New</span> Brunswick, Maine and Vermont.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were secured. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got loose," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the <span class="marked id-unique-8055">train got</span> released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-8061">photos and videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had started before the train
derailed in the town. The Nantes fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-8045">Lapointe
said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8042">Saturday night</span>.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky <span class="marked id-unique-8064">Saturday afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
kilometre away. "They should never allow trains carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly businesses destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this morning (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown area was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-8062">Facebook group</span>
was quickly <span class="marked id-unique-8060">set up to help</span> people track down loved ones
who couldn't be reached by phone.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-8063">Red Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-8063">Red Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 <span class="marked id-unique-8049">firefighters on the scene</span> and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” <span class="marked id-unique-8037">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-8038">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the <span class="marked id-unique-8037">prime minister</span> added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-8040">assistance requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-8059">Friday night</span>.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what

toll on residents

The <span class="marked id-unique-8069">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-8070">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-8071">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a <span class="marked id-unique-8065">train derailment</span> that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-8073">least one</span> person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-8074">carrying crude</span> oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

oil</span> after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,

several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-8079">000 people</span>. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) <span class="marked id-unique-8081">Quebec provincial</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8082">police said</span> Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-8080">death toll</span> would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson <span class="marked id-unique-8083">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-8084">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-8085">reported <span class="marked id-unique-8087">missing</span>
than people</span> actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how <span class="marked id-unique-8089">many people</span> were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-8077">assistance and had not requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-8088">chief Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-8093">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-8094">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-8095">President and <span class="marked id-unique-8096">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-8097">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8098">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8086">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-8099">parent</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8100">company</span>
of Montreal</span>, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
<span class="marked id-unique-8102">said the train</span> was parked <span class="marked id-unique-8067">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-8091">aren't <span class="marked id-unique-8104">properly</span> applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-8105">train, it's going</span> to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-8106">brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-8104">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8107">applied</span> on this train</span>." He <span class="marked id-unique-8102">said the train</span> was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-8090">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-8108">finished</span> his run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-8093">Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-8094">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-8082">Police said</span> it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves <span class="marked id-unique-8103">Maine, Vermont</span>,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone <span class="marked id-unique-8109">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-8101">described</span> the scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-8110">popular area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-8079">000 people</span> from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-8066">town
of 6,000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some <span class="marked id-unique-8068">crude oil</span> spilled into the nearby <span class="marked id-unique-8092">Chaudiere River</span>.

          <div class="ref"><p class="info-text">Reference (train-ap-org):</p><pre>
LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) - Fires continued burning late
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway <span class="marked id-unique-8072">train carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8068">crude oil</span> derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-8075">eastern Quebec</span>, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and killed at
<span class="marked id-unique-8073">least one</span> person. <span class="marked id-unique-8082">Police said</span> they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-8080">death toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-8069">residents of Lac-Megantic</span> scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the 73-car train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-8079">000 people</span> were forced from their homes in the
lakeside <span class="marked id-unique-8066">town of 6,000</span> people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) west of the Maine border.

<span class="marked id-unique-8081">Quebec provincial</span> police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
might be dead, but said authorities have been told "<span class="marked id-unique-8089">many"
people</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-8085">reported missing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-8083">Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-8084">Guy</span> Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with <span class="marked id-unique-8081">Quebec provincial</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8082">police, said</span>: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found deceased unfortunately."

Lapointe refused to give any estimate of people unaccounted
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones <span class="marked id-unique-8087">missing, some
people</span> are reported two, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to explode
in the downtown, a <span class="marked id-unique-8110">popular area</span> packed with bars that
often bustles on summer weekend nights.

<span class="marked id-unique-8082">Police said</span> the first explosion tore through the town
shortly after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then spread to
several homes.

"When you see the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional <span class="marked id-unique-8111">Mayor
Colette</span> Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-8095">president and <span class="marked id-unique-8096">CEO</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-8097">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8098">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8086">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-8099">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8100">company</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-8093">Montreal</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-8094">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-8102">said the
train</span> had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-8067">uphill of Lac-Megantic</span>.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-8091">aren't <span class="marked id-unique-8104">properly</span> applied</span> on a <span class="marked id-unique-8105">train, it's going</span>
to run away," said Edward Burkhardt. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-8106">brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-8104">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8107">applied</span> on this train</span>."

Burkhardt, who was mystified by the disaster, <span class="marked id-unique-8102">said the
train</span> was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-8090">engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-8108">finished</span> his run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts came over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
buildings. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early morning sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People started running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire <span class="marked id-unique-8088">chief Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-8109">Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-8101">described</span> the
scene</span> as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant near the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it came like a fireball," he said.

Another resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-8101">described the scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a large but undetermined amount of fuel had also spilled
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the <span class="marked id-unique-8092">Chaudiere River</span>."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were called in to help deal with
the disaster.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the <span class="marked id-unique-8076">Quebec town</span>, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-8070">Prime <span class="marked id-unique-8071">Minister</span> Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic <span class="marked id-unique-8065">train
derailment</span> and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
quickly. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to provide any <span class="marked id-unique-8077">assistance
requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
<span class="marked id-unique-8093">Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-8094">Maine</span> & Atlantic</span>. According to the railroad's
website, the company owns more than 500 miles (800
kilometers) of track serving <span class="marked id-unique-8103">Maine, Vermont</span>, Quebec and
New Brunswick.

Last week a <span class="marked id-unique-8072">train carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was likely to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state officials
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank <span class="marked id-unique-8078">cars <span class="marked id-unique-8074">carrying</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-8068">crude</span> oil</span> across the state.

The <span class="marked id-unique-8093">Montreal, Maine</span> and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the trains
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

<span class="marked id-unique-12236">Harper</span> to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: <span class="marked id-unique-12204">Emotional</span>

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of <span class="marked id-unique-12198">devastating</span> explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-12229">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12230">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-12236">Harper</span> is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-12228">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a <span class="marked id-unique-12216">number</span> of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-12205">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-12241">around</span> 30
<span class="marked id-unique-12232">buildings</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12234">sent</span> large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-12219">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
<span class="marked id-unique-12238">several</span> explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-12201">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death <span class="marked id-unique-12214">toll</span> would likely <span class="marked id-unique-12193">rise</span>.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12211">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-12226">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-12200">fears</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-12235">five</span> of the tankers cars
might still explode.  <span class="marked id-unique-12241">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-12195">fighting</span> multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-12235">five</span> tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
<span class="marked id-unique-12196">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-12218">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-12223">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-12239">Rail</span> World Inc., the parent <span class="marked id-unique-12237">company</span>
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-12212">Edward</span> Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-12221">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-12240">brakes</span>
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-12240">brakes</span> were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-12224">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-12237">company</span> told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-12194">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-12207">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12202">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-12197">engine</span> was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12217">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12220">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of <span class="marked id-unique-12239">rail</span> tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-12225">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
<span class="marked id-unique-12233">massive</span> balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-12222">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-12206">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-12216">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-12227">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-12199">reached</span> by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-12215">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-12208">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-12223">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12231">Chaudiere</span> River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-12210">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12213">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12209">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-12203">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

<span class="marked id-unique-12219">Canada</span> train blast: Lac-Megantic death <span class="marked id-unique-12214">toll</span> set to <span class="marked id-unique-12193">rise</span>

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US <span class="marked id-unique-12239">rail</span> crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-12226">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast <span class="marked id-unique-12234">sent</span> a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-12201">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-12232">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-12203">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-12197">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

<span class="marked id-unique-12239">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12237">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12222">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-12207">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12202">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-12199">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-12211">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-12216">number</span> of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-12214">toll</span>."

He said some people had been reported missing <span class="marked id-unique-12238">several</span>
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-12195">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-12216">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-12225">described</span> how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-12241">around</span> and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-12235">five</span> locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-12237">company</span> spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-12212">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-12224">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-12240">brakes</span> on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-12194">Joe</span> McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-12236">Harper</span>: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-12218">happened</span> is shocking
and truly <span class="marked id-unique-12198">devastating</span>" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-12240">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a <span class="marked id-unique-12233">massive</span> fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-12223">nearby</span> homes and <span class="marked id-unique-12205">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid <span class="marked id-unique-12200">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers <span class="marked id-unique-12196">exploding</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-12228">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-12221">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-12204">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12210">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12213">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12209">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-12229">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12230">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-12236">Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-12208">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-12223">nearby</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12231">Chaudiere</span> river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-12215">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-12206">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-12227">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12217">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12220">Brunswick</span>.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

of the <span class="marked id-unique-12247">train -- which</span> was carrying crude <span class="marked id-unique-12269">oil -- also</span> set
off a number of fires, which quickly <span class="marked id-unique-12350">spread</span> to many homes

<span class="marked id-unique-12383">President</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12372">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-12376">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12390">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-12384">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-12377">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the <span class="marked id-unique-12280">incident</span>.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
<span class="marked id-unique-12292">doesn't</span> understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-12403">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-12394">finished</span> his run.
A <span class="marked id-unique-12263">representative</span> from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-12398">CTV</span> News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-12319">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-12355">Nantes</span>,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-12344">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, late <span class="marked id-unique-12331">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-12378">two</span>

a <span class="marked id-unique-12244">vice</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12383">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the

and "<span class="marked id-unique-12408">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12380">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-12407">tracks</span>." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-12337">engine</span> was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-12360">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions <span class="marked id-unique-12348">took</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12324">place</span>.  Police said it's too early
to <span class="marked id-unique-12252">speculate</span> what caused the derailment.  According to
the <span class="marked id-unique-12299">company's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12345">website</span>, the railway <span class="marked id-unique-12257">serves</span> Maine, Vermont,

on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported <span class="marked id-unique-12329">hearing</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12327">multiple</span> explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-12258">seeing</span> flames <span class="marked id-unique-12255">shoot</span> up as <span class="marked id-unique-12363">high</span> as

the <span class="marked id-unique-12322">region</span>.  According to officials, the blasts <span class="marked id-unique-12348">took</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12324">place</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12354">near</span> the downtown <span class="marked id-unique-12298">core - a</span> popular area during
the <span class="marked id-unique-12302">busy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12349">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12353">nights</span>.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-12406">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in <span class="marked id-unique-12317">shock</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12332">following</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-12318">series</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-12338">devastating</span> explosions. <span class="marked id-unique-12306">Aphrodite</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12261">Salas</span> has more.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper is set to <span class="marked id-unique-12313">visit</span> Lac-Megantic,
Que., <span class="marked id-unique-12250">Sunday</span>, where he will see <span class="marked id-unique-12284">firsthand</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-12293">devastation</span>
caused by a train derailment that set off <span class="marked id-unique-12265">powerful</span>
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-12361">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the <span class="marked id-unique-12247">train -- which</span> was carrying crude <span class="marked id-unique-12269">oil -- also</span> set
off a number of fires, which quickly <span class="marked id-unique-12350">spread</span> to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-12400">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent <span class="marked id-unique-12358">large</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12364">fireballs</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12272">mushroom</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12371">clouds</span>

the <span class="marked id-unique-12275">line</span> ... there will be more people reported missing

<span class="marked id-unique-12385">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-12395">explode</span>.  Around <span class="marked id-unique-12312">125</span> firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-12334">fighting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12327">multiple</span> fires into
the night. They <span class="marked id-unique-12274">managed</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-12291">douse</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-12393">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12379">tankers</span> with

<span class="marked id-unique-12336">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not <span class="marked id-unique-12262">require</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12286">federal</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12402">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-12381">requested</span> any

<span class="marked id-unique-12270">need</span>," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-12368">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During <span class="marked id-unique-12260">Saturday's</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-12340">conference</span> Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-12300">community</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-12399">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.

said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-12377">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the <span class="marked id-unique-12280">incident</span>.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
<span class="marked id-unique-12292">doesn't</span> understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-12403">aren't</span> properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-12394">finished</span> his run.
A <span class="marked id-unique-12263">representative</span> from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-12398">CTV</span> News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-12319">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-12355">Nantes</span>,

the explosions <span class="marked id-unique-12348">took</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12324">place</span>.  Police said it's too early

<span class="marked id-unique-12436">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-12441">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-12438">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-12486">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-12446">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-12433">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-12426">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-12444">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-12434">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-12429">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-12493">Inc</span>., which <span class="marked id-unique-12489">owns</span> the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-12472">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:<span class="marked id-unique-12491">30</span> a.m.

of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-12458">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12481">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-12431">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-12481">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-12466">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-12447">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12485">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12483">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-12484">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-12485">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12483">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-12469">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-12440">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-12484">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-12461">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-12414">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-12464">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-12432">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-12492">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-12472">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-12455">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-12450">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-12474">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-12487">According</span> to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-12415">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-12473">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12463">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12465">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12489">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-12448">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war <span class="marked id-unique-12488">zone</span> Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war <span class="marked id-unique-12488">zone</span>." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-12487">According</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-12468">officials</span>, the blasts took
place <span class="marked id-unique-12421">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-12428">AP</span>) - Fires continued <span class="marked id-unique-12445">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12464">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-12459">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-12423">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-12470">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-12424">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-12454">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-12461">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war <span class="marked id-unique-12488">zone</span>.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-12414">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-12436">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-12471">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-12486">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12457">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12490">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-12443">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12416">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-12490">Lapointe</span> refused to <span class="marked id-unique-12439">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-12425">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-12417">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-12432">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-12441">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-12418">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-12420">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-12452">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-12419">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-12477">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-12466">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-12442">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12456">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12460">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12453">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-12492">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12427">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-12430">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12493">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-12435">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-12431">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-12447">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12485">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12483">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-12484">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-12458">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12481">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-12485">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12483">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-12481">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-12480">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-12469">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-12440">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-12484">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-12472">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-12491">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12482">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-12455">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-12450">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-12426">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-12488">zone</span>.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-12489">owns</span> a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-12421">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-12472">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-12429">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-12422">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-12451">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-12438">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-12462">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-12444">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-12480">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-12487">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-12478">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12479">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12476">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-12467">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-12434">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-12446">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12433">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-12487">According</span> to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-12415">website</span>, the company <span class="marked id-unique-12489">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-12449">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-12448">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-12475">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-12473">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-12463">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12465">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-12437">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-12468">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some <span class="marked id-unique-12491">30</span>,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-12474">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  <span class="marked id-unique-12500">CTV</span> National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-12511">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12512">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12510">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-12515">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-12506">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-12514">Lac</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12513">Megantic</span>, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police <span class="marked id-unique-12494">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-12495">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-12498">might</span> still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-12505">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-12518">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-12517">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-12507">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-12500">CTV</span> News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-12504">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in <span class="marked id-unique-12496">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-12517">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-12503">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started <span class="marked id-unique-12497">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-12509">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-12516">According</span> to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-12508">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-12516">According</span> to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-12502">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-12501">afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-12518">nearby</span> Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-12499">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At <span class="marked id-unique-12515">least</span> one person has died, <span class="marked id-unique-12500">CTV</span> News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-12499">full</span> of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, <span class="marked id-unique-12500">CTV</span> News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing <span class="marked id-unique-12498">might</span> have been
out of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-12516">According</span> to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in <span class="marked id-unique-12514">Lac</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12513">Megantic</span> early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-12503">morning</span> was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
<span class="marked id-unique-12494">spokesperson</span> for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-12501">afternoon</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-12502">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-12509">train's</span> conductor stopped in <span class="marked id-unique-12518">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12496">Nantes</span>, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train <span class="marked id-unique-12507">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12517">loose</span>,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-12504">73-car</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-12495">actually</span> detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
<span class="marked id-unique-12519">series</span> of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-12556">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12558">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12553">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,

caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-12564">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-12545">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom <span class="marked id-unique-12562">clouds</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-12554">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-12568">Smoke</span> rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-12528">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would <span class="marked id-unique-12529">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-12548">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-12531">give</span> an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't <span class="marked id-unique-12521">reach</span> a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-12527">fears</span> that five of the tankers cars
might still <span class="marked id-unique-12533">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-12530">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  <span class="marked id-unique-12569">Local</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12567">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
<span class="marked id-unique-12559">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the <span class="marked id-unique-12523">firemen</span> that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-12543">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-12534">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-12565">going</span> to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-12546">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-12542">late</span> Friday night. The two
town centres are about <span class="marked id-unique-12524">12</span> kilometres apart.  Joe <span class="marked id-unique-12563">McGonigle</span>,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the <span class="marked id-unique-12570">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-12551">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions <span class="marked id-unique-12561">took</span> place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12541">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12544">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-12570">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-12547">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-12550">Witnesses</span> reported <span class="marked id-unique-12522">hearing</span>
multiple explosions and seeing <span class="marked id-unique-12566">flames</span> shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-12526">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and <span class="marked id-unique-12562">clouds</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-12568">smoke</span> emanating from
the <span class="marked id-unique-12520">region</span>.  According to officials, the blasts <span class="marked id-unique-12561">took</span>
place near the downtown core - a <span class="marked id-unique-12557">popular</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12549">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The <span class="marked id-unique-12560">disaster</span> forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-12536">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-12559">help</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12552">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by <span class="marked id-unique-12525">phone</span>.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-12540">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-12560">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-12526">high</span> speed,
sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-12519">series</span> of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-12564">least</span> 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-12548">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-12536">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with <span class="marked id-unique-12566">flames</span> shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-12554">sky</span> and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-12568">smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-12550">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-12522">hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge <span class="marked id-unique-12562">clouds</span> of thick acrid <span class="marked id-unique-12568">smoke</span> could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-12560">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-12533">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
almost <span class="marked id-unique-12524">12</span> hours after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-12567">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-12528">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid <span class="marked id-unique-12527">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to <span class="marked id-unique-12521">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-12525">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-12542">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-12538">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12539">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12537">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-12531">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the <span class="marked id-unique-12523">firemen</span> haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-12555">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-12565">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-12556">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12558">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12553">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-12561">took</span> to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-12552">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12541">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12544">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-12563">McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-12543">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-12546">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-12532">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-12529">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-12545">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the <span class="marked id-unique-12570">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-12547">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-12551">train's</span> cargo <span class="marked id-unique-12535">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-12568">smoke</span> in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-12530">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the <span class="marked id-unique-12569">local</span> municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-12540">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-12534">called</span> in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-12559">help</span> deal with the <span class="marked id-unique-12560">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-12559">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
<span class="marked id-unique-12520">region</span>, an <span class="marked id-unique-12549">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12557">popular</span> with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

of the town due to fears that <span class="marked id-unique-12626">five</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-12585">tankers</span> cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at

for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-12591">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-12621">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-12602">73-car</span> train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-12573">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-12580">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-12632">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12576">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-12584">two</span>
town centres are about 12 <span class="marked id-unique-12590">kilometres</span> apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-12625">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-12599">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-12598">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12586">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-12597">tracks</span>." He said the

300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-12574">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12571">videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of <span class="marked id-unique-12629">smoke</span> emanating from

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-12585">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-12581">high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with <span class="marked id-unique-12585">tankers</span> of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-12586">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-12628">afternoon</span> police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-12609">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by <span class="marked id-unique-12632">late</span> evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12600">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-12592">deceased</span>." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-12572">shock</span> wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
<span class="marked id-unique-12631">homes</span>, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-12627">businesses</span> and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-12597">tracks</span> that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-12618">kilometre</span> away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-12626">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-12615">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-12611">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-12584">two</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12590">kilometres</span> from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-12603">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-12597">tracks</span>, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-12632">Late</span> Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-12593">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-12601">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12616">Burkhardt</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-12605">chief</span>
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-12582">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-12589">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-12602">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-12583">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-12591">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-12621">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-12595">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12622">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12617">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-12623">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-12621">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-12616">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-12622">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12617">applied</span> on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-12608">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway <span class="marked id-unique-12624">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-12596">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12590">kilometres</span> of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-12604">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12607">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-12612">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-12573">secured</span>. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-12625">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-12633">happened</span>, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-12633">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-12606">Canada</span> is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-12574">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12571">videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had <span class="marked id-unique-12598">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-12580">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing <span class="marked id-unique-12629">smoke</span> continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-12628">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black <span class="marked id-unique-12629">smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
<span class="marked id-unique-12618">kilometre</span> away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-12613">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-12627">businesses</span> destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-12624">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-12599">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-12610">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-12577">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12575">group</span>
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-12615">help</span> people track down loved ones
who <span class="marked id-unique-12620">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-12578">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-12579">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-12630">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12619">Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-12630">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12619">Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-12614">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-12631">homes</span> safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-12588">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-12594">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12587">requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-12576">Friday</span> night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't <span class="marked id-unique-12629">smoke</span>, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a

<span class="marked id-unique-12698">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12699">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12696">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,

caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-12643">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-12687">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12639">spread</span> to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-12711">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12702">buildings</span> and sent <span class="marked id-unique-12642">large</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12644">fireballs</span> and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (<span class="marked id-unique-12648">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-12690">death</span> toll would <span class="marked id-unique-12657">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-12663">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-12636">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12677">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12710">Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-12691">dead</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-12710">Lapointe</span> would not
<span class="marked id-unique-12659">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-12645">estimate</span> to how many people were <span class="marked id-unique-12637">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-12656">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-12661">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-12658">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-12706">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-12666">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-12653">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-12646">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-12664">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-12654">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-12649">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-12713">Inc</span>., which <span class="marked id-unique-12709">owns</span> the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-12692">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:<span class="marked id-unique-12711">30</span> a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-12712">President</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12647">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-12650">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12713">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-12655">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-12678">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12701">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-12651">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-12701">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-12686">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-12667">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12705">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12703">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-12704">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-12705">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12703">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-12689">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-12660">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-12704">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-12681">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-12634">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-12684">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-12652">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-12712">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-12692">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-12675">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-12670">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-12694">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-12707">According</span> to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-12635">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-12693">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-12683">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12685">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12709">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-12668">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war <span class="marked id-unique-12708">zone</span> Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war <span class="marked id-unique-12708">zone</span>." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-12707">According</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-12688">officials</span>, the blasts took
place <span class="marked id-unique-12641">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-12638">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12640">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-12700">disaster</span> forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-12669">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-12672">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-12695">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-12674">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-12682">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-12700">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-12671">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-12676">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12680">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12673">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-12648">AP</span>) - Fires continued <span class="marked id-unique-12665">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12684">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-12679">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-12643">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-12690">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-12644">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-12674">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-12681">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war <span class="marked id-unique-12708">zone</span>.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-12634">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-12656">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-12691">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-12706">authorities</span> have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-12677">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12710">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-12663">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12636">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-12710">Lapointe</span> refused to <span class="marked id-unique-12659">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-12645">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-12637">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-12652">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-12661">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-12638">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-12640">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-12672">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-12639">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-12697">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-12686">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-12662">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12676">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12680">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12673">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-12712">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-12647">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-12650">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12713">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-12655">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-12651">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-12667">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12705">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12703">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-12704">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-12678">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12701">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-12705">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12703">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-12701">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-12700">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-12689">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-12660">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-12704">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-12692">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-12711">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12702">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-12675">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-12670">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-12646">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-12708">zone</span>.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-12709">owns</span> a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-12641">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-12692">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-12649">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-12642">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-12671">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-12658">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-12682">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-12664">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-12700">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-12707">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-12698">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12699">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12696">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-12687">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-12654">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-12666">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-12653">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. <span class="marked id-unique-12707">According</span> to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-12635">website</span>, the company <span class="marked id-unique-12709">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-12669">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-12668">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-12695">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-12693">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-12683">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-12685">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-12657">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-12688">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some <span class="marked id-unique-12711">30</span>,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-12694">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

<span class="marked id-unique-17052">Harper</span> to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve

The residents of <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a
series of <span class="marked id-unique-17041">devastating</span> explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-17085">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17086">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-17052">Harper</span> is <span class="marked id-unique-17091">set</span> to visit <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span>,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-17084">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that <span class="marked id-unique-17091">set</span> off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also <span class="marked id-unique-17091">set</span>
off a <span class="marked id-unique-17035">number</span> of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-17050">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-17082">around</span> 30
<span class="marked id-unique-17088">buildings</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17093">sent</span> large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway <span class="marked id-unique-17090">cars</span> that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-17073">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-17046">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span>. (AP Photo/The <span class="marked id-unique-17066">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17095">Press</span>, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial <span class="marked id-unique-17075">police</span> said Saturday night
that the death <span class="marked id-unique-17034">toll</span> would likely <span class="marked id-unique-17036">rise</span>.  "We do <span class="marked id-unique-17069">expect</span>
we'll have other <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> who will be <span class="marked id-unique-17068">found</span> deceased,
unfortunately," <span class="marked id-unique-17075">police</span> spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17063">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also <span class="marked id-unique-17069">expect</span> that down
the line ... there will be more <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> reported missing
than <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> actually <span class="marked id-unique-17068">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17081">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-17045">fears</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-17076">five</span> of the tankers <span class="marked id-unique-17090">cars</span>
might still explode.  <span class="marked id-unique-17082">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-17038">fighting</span> multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-17076">five</span> tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
<span class="marked id-unique-17039">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span> fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-17072">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-17042">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-17067">hours</span> before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  <span class="marked id-unique-17058">Montreal</span> Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17089">Atlantic</span>
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-17094">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of <span class="marked id-unique-17054">Rail</span> World Inc., the parent <span class="marked id-unique-17053">company</span>
of <span class="marked id-unique-17058">Montreal</span>, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17089">Atlantic</span> Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-17064">Edward</span> Burkhardt
said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-17043">parked</span> uphill of <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The <span class="marked id-unique-17066">Canadian</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17095">Press</span> that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-17077">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-17055">brakes</span>
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-17055">brakes</span> were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-17043">parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-17079">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-17053">company</span> told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was <span class="marked id-unique-17043">parked</span> and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span>, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-17037">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a vice president at <span class="marked id-unique-17058">Montreal</span>, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17089">Atlantic</span>, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-17094">came</span> loose" in the early morning <span class="marked id-unique-17067">hours</span> Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-17059">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17047">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-17040">engine</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-17068">found</span> about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  <span class="marked id-unique-17075">Police</span> said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-17071">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17074">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of <span class="marked id-unique-17054">rail</span> tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-17080">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
<span class="marked id-unique-17057">massive</span> balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-17078">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-17051">500</span> and 2,000 <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-17035">number</span> of
<span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was <span class="marked id-unique-17091">set</span> up to help <span class="marked id-unique-17083">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-17044">reached</span> by phone.
The Red Cross had <span class="marked id-unique-17091">set</span> up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-17070">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-17060">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-17042">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17087">Chaudiere</span> River.

of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

US train derailment Bridge collapses after US <span class="marked id-unique-17054">rail</span> crash
<span class="marked id-unique-17075">Police</span> have said they <span class="marked id-unique-17069">expect</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> to be <span class="marked id-unique-17068">found</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17081">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the <span class="marked id-unique-17066">Canadian</span> town of <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span>.

The blast <span class="marked id-unique-17093">sent</span> a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-17046">evacuation</span> of 1,000 <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span>.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-17088">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of <span class="marked id-unique-17058">Montreal</span>.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-17048">full</span> of customers. <span class="marked id-unique-17075">Police</span> are trying
to account for dozens of missing <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span>.

The train's <span class="marked id-unique-17090">cars</span> reportedly uncoupled from a <span class="marked id-unique-17043">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17040">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

<span class="marked id-unique-17054">Rail</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17053">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17078">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-17059">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17047">rolling</span> downhill
into <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span>.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-17044">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we <span class="marked id-unique-17069">expect</span> there
will be others," said <span class="marked id-unique-17075">police</span> spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-17063">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also <span class="marked id-unique-17069">expect</span> that the <span class="marked id-unique-17035">number</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> reported missing
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-17034">toll</span>."

He said some <span class="marked id-unique-17056">people</span> had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-17038">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-17067">hours</span>.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-17035">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 <span class="marked id-unique-17067">hours</span>
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
<span class="marked id-unique-17095">Press</span> news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-17080">described</span> how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and <span class="marked id-unique-17094">came</span> to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned <span class="marked id-unique-17082">around</span> and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The <span class="marked id-unique-17058">Montreal</span>, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17089">Atlantic</span> train had <span class="marked id-unique-17076">five</span> locomotive
engines and 73 <span class="marked id-unique-17090">cars</span> filled with light crude oil, and
was <span class="marked id-unique-17043">parked</span> in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a <span class="marked id-unique-17053">company</span> spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-17064">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-17079">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17043">parked</span> the train and put the <span class="marked id-unique-17055">brakes</span> on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The <span class="marked id-unique-17090">cars</span> filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-17037">Joe</span> McGonigle.


<span class="marked id-unique-17066">Canadian</span> PM Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-17052">Harper</span>: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-17072">happened</span> is shocking
and truly <span class="marked id-unique-17041">devastating</span>" "It seems that the <span class="marked id-unique-17055">brakes</span> were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
<span class="marked id-unique-17068">found</span> the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-17090">cars</span> exploded, creating a <span class="marked id-unique-17057">massive</span> fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-17042">nearby</span> homes and <span class="marked id-unique-17050">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was <span class="marked id-unique-17091">set</span> up amid <span class="marked id-unique-17045">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers <span class="marked id-unique-17039">exploding</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-17084">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-17077">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-17049">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17062">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17065">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17061">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-17085">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17086">Minister</span> Stephen <span class="marked id-unique-17052">Harper</span> said in a statement: "Our

and subsequent fires in <span class="marked id-unique-17092">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-17060">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-17042">nearby</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-17321">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-17299">estimate</span> to how <span class="marked id-unique-17371">many</span> people were <span class="marked id-unique-17291">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-17318">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-17323">explode</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-17362">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the <span class="marked id-unique-17282">scene</span>, and <span class="marked id-unique-17371">many</span> were fighting multiple <span class="marked id-unique-17361">fires</span> into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-17320">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-17380">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-17328">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-17315">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-17378">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17300">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17373">Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference <span class="marked id-unique-17373">Lauzon</span> said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-17326">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-17316">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-17303">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17284">Atlantic</span>
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-17353">Inc</span>., which <span class="marked id-unique-17309">owns</span> the train, says the train was

said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-17313">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-17286">Burkhardt</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17354">told</span> The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-17355">understand</span> how the train got <span class="marked id-unique-17334">away</span>.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-17335">brakes</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17329">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17305">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17287">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-17304">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17334">away</span>," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-17335">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-17305">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17287">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-17358">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17322">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-17304">run</span>.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-17333">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17354">told</span> CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-17347">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-17288">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-17350">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-17314">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-17352">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17284">Atlantic</span>, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-17283">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-17341">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-17336">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-17364">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what <span class="marked id-unique-17375">caused</span> the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-17306">According</span> to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-17289">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-17363">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-17349">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17351">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17309">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-17330">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war <span class="marked id-unique-17308">zone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17373">Lauzon</span> described the <span class="marked id-unique-17282">scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war <span class="marked id-unique-17308">zone</span>." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the <span class="marked id-unique-17282">scene</span> showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-17306">According</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-17357">officials</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-17379">blasts</span> took
place <span class="marked id-unique-17295">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-17292">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17294">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-17285">disaster</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17374">forced</span> between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-17331">500</span> and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-17307">000</span> people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-17377">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-17338">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-17365">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-17340">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-17348">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-17285">disaster</span> also <span class="marked id-unique-17374">forced</span> the town
of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-17307">000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-17302">AP</span>) - <span class="marked id-unique-17361">Fires</span> continued <span class="marked id-unique-17327">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17350">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-17372">carrying</span>
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-17345">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and <span class="marked id-unique-17361">fires</span> that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-17297">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-17359">death</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17376">toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-17298">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-17340">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-17347">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire <span class="marked id-unique-17378">chief</span> likened the charred <span class="marked id-unique-17282">scene</span> to a war <span class="marked id-unique-17308">zone</span>.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-17307">000</span> people were <span class="marked id-unique-17374">forced</span> from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-17307">000</span> people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-17288">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how <span class="marked id-unique-17371">many</span> others
<span class="marked id-unique-17318">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-17360">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-17380">authorities</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-17354">told</span> "<span class="marked id-unique-17371">many</span>"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17343">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17310">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-17325">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17290">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-17310">Lapointe</span> refused to <span class="marked id-unique-17321">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-17299">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-17291">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-17377">number</span>.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-17314">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-17375">caused</span> several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-17323">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-17292">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-17294">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-17338">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-17293">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-17367">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-17355">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-17324">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17342">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17346">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17339">Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17354">told</span> a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-17352">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17301">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-17312">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17353">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-17317">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17333">company</span> of Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17284">Atlantic</span> Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-17313">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-17335">brakes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17329">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17305">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17287">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-17304">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17334">away</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-17344">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17286">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-17335">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-17305">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17287">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-17286">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-17285">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-17358">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17322">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-17304">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-17379">blasts</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17283">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-17311">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17370">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-17371">many</span> shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-17341">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-17336">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire <span class="marked id-unique-17378">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17300">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17373">Lauzon</span> described the
<span class="marked id-unique-17282">scene</span> as one akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-17308">zone</span>.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-17371">many</span> feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-17362">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-17309">owns</span> a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-17295">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) <span class="marked id-unique-17334">away</span>.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-17283">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-17303">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the <span class="marked id-unique-17282">scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-17296">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-17337">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-17320">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-17348">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-17326">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-17285">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-17306">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-17368">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17369">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17366">Stephen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17332">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent <span class="marked id-unique-17361">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-17332">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-17356">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-17316">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-17328">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17315">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17284">Atlantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-17306">According</span> to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-17289">website</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-17333">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17309">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-17331">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-17330">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-17365">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-17363">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-17349">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17351">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train <span class="marked id-unique-17372">carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-17319">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-17357">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-17372">carrying</span>
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-17284">Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some <span class="marked id-unique-17311">30</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-17307">000</span> gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-17364">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Harper to visit Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-17399">town</span> devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. <span class="marked id-unique-17399">town</span>. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  <span class="marked id-unique-17381">CTV</span> National <span class="marked id-unique-17396">News</span>: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-17406">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17407">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17405">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-17408">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-17401">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train
carrying crude <span class="marked id-unique-17412">oil</span> is still burning in the eastern Quebec
<span class="marked id-unique-17399">town</span> of Lac-Megantic Saturday, July 6, 2013. (Surete
du Quebec)

Smoke rises from railway <span class="marked id-unique-17390">cars</span> that were carrying crude <span class="marked id-unique-17412">oil</span>
after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-17392">Lac</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17391">Megantic</span>, Que., Saturday,

Smoke rises from railway <span class="marked id-unique-17390">cars</span> that were carrying crude
<span class="marked id-unique-17412">oil</span> after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-17392">Lac</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17391">Megantic</span>, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police <span class="marked id-unique-17382">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a <span class="marked id-unique-17396">news</span> conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people <span class="marked id-unique-17411">reported</span> missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-17383">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the <span class="marked id-unique-17399">town</span> due to fears that five of the tankers <span class="marked id-unique-17390">cars</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17387">might</span> still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-17397">happened</span> During Saturday's <span class="marked id-unique-17396">news</span> conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-17410">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, <span class="marked id-unique-17409">says</span> the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-17398">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-17402">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-17381">CTV</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17396">News</span> Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-17395">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in <span class="marked id-unique-17384">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
<span class="marked id-unique-17399">town</span> centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-17398">loose</span>" in the <span class="marked id-unique-17400">early</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17394">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started <span class="marked id-unique-17386">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-17404">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too <span class="marked id-unique-17400">early</span>
to speculate what caused the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-17385">According</span> to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-17403">Witnesses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17411">reported</span> hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-17385">According</span> to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-17393">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-17389">afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the <span class="marked id-unique-17399">town</span>
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude <span class="marked id-unique-17412">oil</span> spilled into the <span class="marked id-unique-17410">nearby</span> Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-17388">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

The residents of <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span> are in shock following a

Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-17461">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
<span class="marked id-unique-17476">explosions</span> and killed at <span class="marked id-unique-17468">least</span> one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-17449">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The <span class="marked id-unique-17466">blasts</span> destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom <span class="marked id-unique-17434">clouds</span>
into the <span class="marked id-unique-17460">sky</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-17419">Smoke</span> rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-17474">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several <span class="marked id-unique-17476">explosions</span> and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-17425">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-17477">000</span> people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would <span class="marked id-unique-17427">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-17452">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-17429">give</span> an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't <span class="marked id-unique-17415">reach</span> a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-17424">fears</span> that five of the tankers cars
might still <span class="marked id-unique-17431">explode</span>.  Around 125 <span class="marked id-unique-17448">firefighters</span> were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-17428">lake</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17441">water</span> and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-17471">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
<span class="marked id-unique-17420">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the <span class="marked id-unique-17417">firemen</span> that we
need," <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span> chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-17445">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that <span class="marked id-unique-17448">firefighters</span> in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-17432">called</span> to a
<span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span> on the same train a few <span class="marked id-unique-17440">hours</span> before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that <span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span>
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal <span class="marked id-unique-17447">Maine</span> & Atlantic

<span class="marked id-unique-17474">Canada</span>: Train <span class="marked id-unique-17476">explosions</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span>, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-17423">high</span> speed,
sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-17413">series</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17476">explosions</span>.

At <span class="marked id-unique-17468">least</span> 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-17452">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span>
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-17436">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught <span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span>. The
subsequent <span class="marked id-unique-17476">explosions</span> combined into a giant fireball,
with <span class="marked id-unique-17470">flames</span> shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-17460">sky</span> and billowing <span class="marked id-unique-17419">smoke</span>
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-17456">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,<span class="marked id-unique-17477">000</span> people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with <span class="marked id-unique-17447">Maine</span> and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-17416">hearing</span> as many as six
loud <span class="marked id-unique-17466">blasts</span> soon after the derailment.

Huge <span class="marked id-unique-17434">clouds</span> of thick acrid <span class="marked id-unique-17419">smoke</span> could be seen still
rising from the centre of <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span> several <span class="marked id-unique-17440">hours</span>
after the <span class="marked id-unique-17421">disaster</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-17426">Fire</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17472">officials</span> said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-17431">explode</span>. One carriage remained on <span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span>
almost <span class="marked id-unique-17418">12</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17440">hours</span> after the derailment.

<span class="marked id-unique-17471">Authorities</span> set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
<span class="marked id-unique-17448">firefighters</span> battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-17425">evacuation</span> of 1,<span class="marked id-unique-17477">000</span> people.

Worried residents looked on amid <span class="marked id-unique-17424">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to <span class="marked id-unique-17415">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-17422">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-17444">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-17438">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17439">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17437">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-17429">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the <span class="marked id-unique-17417">firemen</span> haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-17461">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-17469">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-17462">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17464">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17459">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-17433">took</span> to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span>. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, <span class="marked id-unique-17447">Maine</span> & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-17458">track</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-17447">Maine</span> and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-17443">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17446">Brunswick</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-17474">Canada</span>.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-17467">McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been <span class="marked id-unique-17475">parked</span> some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-17445">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-17450">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had <span class="marked id-unique-17475">parked</span> the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train <span class="marked id-unique-17473">got</span> released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't <span class="marked id-unique-17473">got</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-17430">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-17427">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-17449">quickly</span> into
the centre of <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span>," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the <span class="marked id-unique-17454">tracks</span>. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in <span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span> resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-17451">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the <span class="marked id-unique-17476">explosions</span>
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-17457">train's</span> cargo <span class="marked id-unique-17435">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of <span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span> should be careful
of using river <span class="marked id-unique-17441">water</span>.

He said: "Right now there is big <span class="marked id-unique-17419">smoke</span> in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-17428">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-17442">take</span> their <span class="marked id-unique-17441">water</span> from
the Chaudiere River."

<span class="marked id-unique-17448">Firefighters</span> and rescue workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-17432">called</span> in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-17420">help</span> deal with the <span class="marked id-unique-17421">disaster</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-17472">Officials</span>
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-17420">help</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-17426">fire</span> services in the
United States.

<span class="marked id-unique-17465">Lac-Megantic</span> is part of Quebec's <span class="marked id-unique-17455">Eastern</span> Townships
<span class="marked id-unique-17414">region</span>, an <span class="marked id-unique-17453">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17463">popular</span> with tourists that is close to the
border with <span class="marked id-unique-17447">Maine</span> and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the <span class="marked id-unique-17455">eastern</span> half of <span class="marked id-unique-17474">Canada</span>.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet <span class="marked id-unique-17551">Que</span>. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> are in <span class="marked id-unique-17483">shock</span> following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-17541">Stephen</span> Harper is <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span> to visit <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-17551">Que</span>., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span> off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span>
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-17553">quickly</span> spread to <span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17521">homes</span>
and <span class="marked id-unique-17530">businesses</span> Saturday.  The <span class="marked id-unique-17547">blasts</span> destroyed around <span class="marked id-unique-17536">30</span>
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the <span class="marked id-unique-17558">sky</span>.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train
carrying crude oil is <span class="marked id-unique-17522">still</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17509">burning</span> in the eastern Quebec

<span class="marked id-unique-17489">Smoke</span> rises from <span class="marked id-unique-17480">railway</span> cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span> Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-17526">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-17556">Press</span>, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-17533">death</span> toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-17508">deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17518">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17535">Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-17555">dead</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-17535">Lapointe</span> would not
give an estimate to how <span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews <span class="marked id-unique-17515">couldn't</span> reach a section
of the town due to fears that <span class="marked id-unique-17529">five</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-17478">tankers</span> cars
might <span class="marked id-unique-17522">still</span> explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and <span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-17529">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17478">tankers</span> with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-17510">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-17504">requested</span> any
<span class="marked id-unique-17490">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> fire <span class="marked id-unique-17525">chief</span> Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-17546">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-17505">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
<span class="marked id-unique-17480">Railway</span> Inc., which <span class="marked id-unique-17499">owns</span> the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-17528">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:<span class="marked id-unique-17536">30</span> a.m.
President and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-17500">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-17506">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic <span class="marked id-unique-17480">Railway</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-17519">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17491">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-17557">parked</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17501">uphill</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-17491">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-17556">Press</span> that he
doesn't understand how the train got <span class="marked id-unique-17543">away</span>.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-17549">brakes</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17511">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17498">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17492">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-17548">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-17497">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17543">away</span>," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-17549">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-17498">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17492">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was <span class="marked id-unique-17557">parked</span>
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-17554">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17507">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-17497">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-17520">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-17557">parked</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17484">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-17495">Nantes</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-17551">Que</span>., just west of <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-17545">late</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17487">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-17502">two</span>
town centres are about 12 <span class="marked id-unique-17479">kilometres</span> apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-17528">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-17517">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-17516">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17503">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-17481">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-17540">train's</span> engine was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-17513">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the <span class="marked id-unique-17480">railway</span> serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-17539">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-17524">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17527">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17499">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-17512">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17479">kilometres</span>
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-17481">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-17538">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-17496">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-17485">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17482">videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of <span class="marked id-unique-17489">smoke</span> emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-17532">officials</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-17547">blasts</span> took
place near the <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span> core - a popular <span class="marked id-unique-17534">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their <span class="marked id-unique-17521">homes</span>, and a number of
people are <span class="marked id-unique-17522">still</span> accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-17488">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17486">group</span> was <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span> up to <span class="marked id-unique-17490">help</span> track down
residents who <span class="marked id-unique-17515">couldn't</span> immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-17493">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-17494">phone</span>.
The <span class="marked id-unique-17537">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17514">Cross</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span> up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-17531">afternoon</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-17523">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
<span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

One <span class="marked id-unique-17555">dead</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> missing as train explodes in <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span>
One person has been declared <span class="marked id-unique-17555">dead</span> after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-17478">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-17496">high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

<span class="marked id-unique-17542">LAC-MEGANTIC</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-17551">QUE</span>.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with <span class="marked id-unique-17478">tankers</span> of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-17503">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-17531">afternoon</span> police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-17533">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span>.

However, by <span class="marked id-unique-17545">late</span> evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17518">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17535">Lapointe</span> of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-17508">deceased</span>." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-17483">shock</span> wave from the explosion destroyed <span class="marked id-unique-17536">30</span> buildings and
<span class="marked id-unique-17521">homes</span>, gutted <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17530">businesses</span> and left dozens of people
- possibly as <span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night <span class="marked id-unique-17558">sky</span>.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the <span class="marked id-unique-17480">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17481">tracks</span> that
pass right through the heart of <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span>, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-17513">kilometre</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17543">away</span> at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-17529">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:<span class="marked id-unique-17536">30</span> a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-17490">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-17538">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are <span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-17502">two</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17479">kilometres</span> from <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span>,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-17523">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the <span class="marked id-unique-17480">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17481">tracks</span>, was among the buildings
demolished by the <span class="marked id-unique-17547">blasts</span>, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. <span class="marked id-unique-17545">Late</span> Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were <span class="marked id-unique-17522">still</span> battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-17509">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-17519">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17491">Burkhardt</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-17525">chief</span>
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-17500">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-17506">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic <span class="marked id-unique-17480">Railway</span>, said the <span class="marked id-unique-17520">73-car</span> train was <span class="marked id-unique-17557">parked</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17501">uphill</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> after the <span class="marked id-unique-17554">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17507">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-17497">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If <span class="marked id-unique-17549">brakes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17511">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17498">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17492">applied</span> on a train, it's <span class="marked id-unique-17548">going</span>
to <span class="marked id-unique-17497">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17543">away</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-17491">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-17549">brakes</span>
were <span class="marked id-unique-17498">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17492">applied</span> on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-17532">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old <span class="marked id-unique-17480">railway</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17499">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-17512">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17479">kilometres</span> of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-17524">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17527">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-17539">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a <span class="marked id-unique-17480">railway</span> vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the <span class="marked id-unique-17549">brakes</span>, ensuring
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-17484">secured</span>. He then checked into a
<span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-17528">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span>
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-17546">happened</span>, but
the <span class="marked id-unique-17554">engineer</span> did everything by the book. He had <span class="marked id-unique-17557">parked</span>
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
<span class="marked id-unique-17544">many</span> fail-safe modes. How this <span class="marked id-unique-17546">happened</span> is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-17526">Canada</span> is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17535">Lapointe</span> said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-17485">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17482">videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had <span class="marked id-unique-17516">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-17495">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," <span class="marked id-unique-17535">Lapointe</span>
said Saturday night.  Billowing <span class="marked id-unique-17489">smoke</span> continued to fill
the <span class="marked id-unique-17558">sky</span> Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-17531">afternoon</span>.  "We can <span class="marked id-unique-17522">still</span> see a lot of
black <span class="marked id-unique-17489">smoke</span> and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
<span class="marked id-unique-17513">kilometre</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17543">away</span>. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-17540">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-17530">businesses</span> destroyed, but about
<span class="marked id-unique-17536">30</span> to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters <span class="marked id-unique-17552">set</span> up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who <span class="marked id-unique-17499">owns</span> a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-17517">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17534">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very

town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-17488">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17486">group</span>

who <span class="marked id-unique-17515">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-17493">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-17494">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the <span class="marked id-unique-17537">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17514">Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said <span class="marked id-unique-17537">Red</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17514">Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-17541">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span>,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their <span class="marked id-unique-17521">homes</span> safely and <span class="marked id-unique-17553">quickly</span>. The
people of <span class="marked id-unique-17542">Lac-Megantic</span> and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-17505">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-17510">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17504">requested</span> by

that they were not <span class="marked id-unique-17550">downtown</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17487">Friday</span> night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't <span class="marked id-unique-17489">smoke</span>, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian <span class="marked id-unique-17556">Press</span>

<span class="marked id-unique-17652">caused</span> by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-17574">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was <span class="marked id-unique-17649">carrying</span> crude oil -- also set
off a <span class="marked id-unique-17654">number</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-17638">fires</span>, which <span class="marked id-unique-17633">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17570">spread</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span> homes

Smoke rises from railway cars that were <span class="marked id-unique-17649">carrying</span> crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-17651">forced</span> the evacuation of up
to 1,<span class="marked id-unique-17584">000</span> people. (<span class="marked id-unique-17579">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-17636">death</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17653">toll</span> would <span class="marked id-unique-17596">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-17602">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-17567">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17620">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17587">Lapointe</span>
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-17637">dead</span>."  <span class="marked id-unique-17587">Lapointe</span> would not
<span class="marked id-unique-17598">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-17576">estimate</span> to how <span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span> people were <span class="marked id-unique-17568">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-17595">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-17600">explode</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-17639">Around</span> 125 firefighters were at
the <span class="marked id-unique-17559">scene</span>, and <span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span> were fighting multiple <span class="marked id-unique-17638">fires</span> into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-17597">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local <span class="marked id-unique-17657">authorities</span> said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-17605">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-17592">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-17655">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17577">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17650">Lauzon</span> said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference <span class="marked id-unique-17650">Lauzon</span> said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-17603">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-17593">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-17580">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17561">Atlantic</span>
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-17630">Inc</span>., which <span class="marked id-unique-17586">owns</span> the train, says the train was

said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-17590">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-17563">Burkhardt</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17631">told</span> The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-17632">understand</span> how the train got <span class="marked id-unique-17611">away</span>.  "If <span class="marked id-unique-17612">brakes</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17606">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17582">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17564">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-17581">run</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17611">away</span>," he said. "But we think the <span class="marked id-unique-17612">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-17582">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17564">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-17635">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17599">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-17581">run</span>.
A representative from the <span class="marked id-unique-17610">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17631">told</span> CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-17624">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-17565">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-17627">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-17591">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-17629">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17561">Atlantic</span>, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-17560">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-17618">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-17613">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-17641">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what <span class="marked id-unique-17652">caused</span> the derailment.  <span class="marked id-unique-17583">According</span> to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-17566">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-17640">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-17626">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17628">Brunswick</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17586">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-17607">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war <span class="marked id-unique-17585">zone</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17650">Lauzon</span> described the <span class="marked id-unique-17559">scene</span>
on Saturday as a "war <span class="marked id-unique-17585">zone</span>." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the <span class="marked id-unique-17559">scene</span> showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  <span class="marked id-unique-17583">According</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-17634">officials</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-17656">blasts</span> took
place <span class="marked id-unique-17572">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-17569">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17571">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-17562">disaster</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17651">forced</span> between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-17608">500</span> and 2,<span class="marked id-unique-17584">000</span> people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-17654">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-17615">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-17642">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-17617">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-17625">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-17562">disaster</span> also <span class="marked id-unique-17651">forced</span> the town
of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-17584">000</span> to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-17614">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-17579">AP</span>) - <span class="marked id-unique-17638">Fires</span> continued <span class="marked id-unique-17604">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17627">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train <span class="marked id-unique-17649">carrying</span>
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-17622">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and <span class="marked id-unique-17638">fires</span> that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-17574">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-17636">death</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17653">toll</span>
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-17575">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-17617">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-17624">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire <span class="marked id-unique-17655">chief</span> likened the charred <span class="marked id-unique-17559">scene</span> to a war <span class="marked id-unique-17585">zone</span>.

Up to 2,<span class="marked id-unique-17584">000</span> people were <span class="marked id-unique-17651">forced</span> from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,<span class="marked id-unique-17584">000</span> people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-17565">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how <span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span> others
<span class="marked id-unique-17595">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-17637">dead</span>, but said <span class="marked id-unique-17657">authorities</span> have been <span class="marked id-unique-17631">told</span> "<span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span>"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-17620">Guy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17587">Lapointe</span>, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-17602">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17567">unfortunately</span>."

<span class="marked id-unique-17587">Lapointe</span> refused to <span class="marked id-unique-17598">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-17576">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-17568">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed <span class="marked id-unique-17654">number</span>.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-17591">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment <span class="marked id-unique-17652">caused</span> several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-17600">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-17569">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-17571">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-17615">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-17570">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-17644">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-17632">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-17601">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17619">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17623">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17616">Roy-Laroche</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17631">told</span> a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-17629">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-17578">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-17589">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17630">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-17594">parent</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17610">company</span> of Montreal, Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17561">Atlantic</span> Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-17590">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If <span class="marked id-unique-17612">brakes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17606">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17582">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17564">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-17581">run</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17611">away</span>," said <span class="marked id-unique-17621">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17563">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
<span class="marked id-unique-17612">brakes</span> were <span class="marked id-unique-17582">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17564">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-17563">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-17562">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-17635">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-17599">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-17581">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The <span class="marked id-unique-17656">blasts</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17560">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least <span class="marked id-unique-17588">30</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17647">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent <span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span> shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-17618">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-17613">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire <span class="marked id-unique-17655">chief</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17577">Denis</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17650">Lauzon</span> described the
<span class="marked id-unique-17559">scene</span> as one akin to a war <span class="marked id-unique-17585">zone</span>.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and <span class="marked id-unique-17648">many</span> feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced <span class="marked id-unique-17639">around</span> a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
<span class="marked id-unique-17586">owns</span> a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-17572">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) <span class="marked id-unique-17611">away</span>.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-17560">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-17580">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the <span class="marked id-unique-17559">scene</span> of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-17573">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-17614">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-17597">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-17625">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-17603">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-17562">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, <span class="marked id-unique-17583">according</span> to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-17645">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17646">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17643">Stephen</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17609">Harper</span> expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent <span class="marked id-unique-17638">fires</span> in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
<span class="marked id-unique-17609">Harper</span> said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-17633">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-17593">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-17605">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-17592">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & <span class="marked id-unique-17561">Atlantic</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-17583">According</span> to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-17566">website</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-17610">company</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17586">owns</span> more than <span class="marked id-unique-17608">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-17607">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-17642">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-17640">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-17626">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-17628">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train <span class="marked id-unique-17649">carrying</span> petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-17596">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-17634">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-17649">carrying</span>
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-17561">Atlantic</span> Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some <span class="marked id-unique-17588">30</span>,<span class="marked id-unique-17584">000</span> gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-17641">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: <span class="marked id-unique-22343">Emotional</span>

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of <span class="marked id-unique-22337">devastating</span> explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-22369">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22370">Minister</span> Stephen Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-22368">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a <span class="marked id-unique-22355">number</span> of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-22344">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
<span class="marked id-unique-22373">buildings</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22374">sent</span> large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-22359">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the <span class="marked id-unique-22340">evacuation</span> of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death <span class="marked id-unique-22353">toll</span> would likely <span class="marked id-unique-22332">rise</span>.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22350">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-22366">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to <span class="marked id-unique-22339">fears</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-22371">five</span> of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-22334">fighting</span> multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-22371">five</span> tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
<span class="marked id-unique-22335">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-22358">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a <span class="marked id-unique-22363">nearby</span> community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-22351">Edward</span> Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-22361">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-22364">engineer</span> had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  <span class="marked id-unique-22333">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-22346">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22341">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-22336">engine</span> was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22356">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22360">Brunswick</span> and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon <span class="marked id-unique-22365">described</span> the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
<span class="marked id-unique-22357">massive</span> balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-22362">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-22345">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a <span class="marked id-unique-22355">number</span> of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-22367">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-22338">reached</span> by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-22354">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-22347">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-22363">nearby</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22372">Chaudiere</span> River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-22349">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22352">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22348">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-22342">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

<span class="marked id-unique-22359">Canada</span> train blast: Lac-Megantic death <span class="marked id-unique-22353">toll</span> set to <span class="marked id-unique-22332">rise</span>

Deaths feared in 'major catastrophe' Watch Explosion after
US train derailment Bridge collapses after US rail crash
Police have said they expect more people to be found <span class="marked id-unique-22366">dead</span>
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast <span class="marked id-unique-22374">sent</span> a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the <span class="marked id-unique-22340">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Dozens of <span class="marked id-unique-22373">buildings</span> were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar <span class="marked id-unique-22342">full</span> of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked <span class="marked id-unique-22336">engine</span>
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company <span class="marked id-unique-22362">officials</span> said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then <span class="marked id-unique-22346">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22341">rolling</span> downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
<span class="marked id-unique-22338">reached</span> the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman <span class="marked id-unique-22350">Guy</span> Lapointe.

"We also expect that the <span class="marked id-unique-22355">number</span> of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death <span class="marked id-unique-22353">toll</span>."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been <span class="marked id-unique-22334">fighting</span> the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a <span class="marked id-unique-22355">number</span> of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman <span class="marked id-unique-22365">described</span> how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had <span class="marked id-unique-22371">five</span> locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, <span class="marked id-unique-22351">Edward</span> Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an <span class="marked id-unique-22364">engineer</span> had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, <span class="marked id-unique-22333">Joe</span> McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has <span class="marked id-unique-22358">happened</span> is shocking
and truly <span class="marked id-unique-22337">devastating</span>" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a <span class="marked id-unique-22357">massive</span> fireball
and setting fire to <span class="marked id-unique-22363">nearby</span> homes and <span class="marked id-unique-22344">businesses</span>.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid <span class="marked id-unique-22339">fears</span> of
more pressurised containers <span class="marked id-unique-22335">exploding</span>.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22368">see</span> the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-22361">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-22343">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22349">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22352">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22348">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

<span class="marked id-unique-22369">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22370">Minister</span> Stephen Harper said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo <span class="marked id-unique-22347">spilled</span> into the <span class="marked id-unique-22363">nearby</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22372">Chaudiere</span> river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to <span class="marked id-unique-22354">take</span> care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (<span class="marked id-unique-22345">500</span> miles) of <span class="marked id-unique-22367">track</span> serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22356">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22360">Brunswick</span>.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.

town <span class="marked id-unique-22434">centres</span> are about <span class="marked id-unique-22476">12</span> kilometres <span class="marked id-unique-22440">apart</span>.  <span class="marked id-unique-22461">Joe</span> McGonigle,
a <span class="marked id-unique-22377">vice</span> president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's <span class="marked id-unique-22470">engine</span> was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-22493">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions <span class="marked id-unique-22481">took</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22457">place</span>.  Police said it's too early
to <span class="marked id-unique-22385">speculate</span> what caused the derailment.  According to
the <span class="marked id-unique-22432">company's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22478">website</span>, the railway <span class="marked id-unique-22390">serves</span> Maine, Vermont,

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in <span class="marked id-unique-22450">shock</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22465">following</span> a
<span class="marked id-unique-22451">series</span> of <span class="marked id-unique-22471">devastating</span> explosions. <span class="marked id-unique-22439">Aphrodite</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22394">Salas</span> has more.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper is set to <span class="marked id-unique-22446">visit</span> Lac-Megantic,
Que., <span class="marked id-unique-22383">Sunday</span>, where he will see <span class="marked id-unique-22417">firsthand</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-22426">devastation</span>
caused by a train derailment that set off <span class="marked id-unique-22398">powerful</span>
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-22494">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the <span class="marked id-unique-22380">train -- which</span> was carrying crude <span class="marked id-unique-22402">oil -- also</span> set
off a number of fires, which quickly <span class="marked id-unique-22483">spread</span> to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent <span class="marked id-unique-22491">large</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22497">fireballs</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22405">mushroom</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22504">clouds</span>
into the sky.

A <span class="marked id-unique-22490">massive</span> fire <span class="marked id-unique-22449">sparked</span> by the derailment of a train

<span class="marked id-unique-22474">Chiasson</span>) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely <span class="marked id-unique-22454">rise</span>.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
<span class="marked id-unique-22479">unfortunately</span>," police <span class="marked id-unique-22448">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news <span class="marked id-unique-22473">conference</span>.  "We also expect that down
the <span class="marked id-unique-22408">line</span> ... there will be more people reported missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-22475">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an <span class="marked id-unique-22500">estimate</span> to how many people were <span class="marked id-unique-22480">unaccounted</span>
for. He said <span class="marked id-unique-22420">emergency</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22430">crews</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22503">couldn't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22456">reach</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-22392">section</span>
of the town <span class="marked id-unique-22422">due</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-22498">fears</span> that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around <span class="marked id-unique-22445">125</span> firefighters were at
the scene, and many were <span class="marked id-unique-22467">fighting</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22460">multiple</span> fires into
the night. They <span class="marked id-unique-22407">managed</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-22424">douse</span> the five tankers with
lake water and <span class="marked id-unique-22416">foam</span>, to <span class="marked id-unique-22410">keep</span> them from <span class="marked id-unique-22401">overheating</span> and
<span class="marked id-unique-22469">exploding</span>.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not <span class="marked id-unique-22395">require</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22419">federal</span> assistance and had not requested any
help from the <span class="marked id-unique-22406">military</span>.  "We have all the <span class="marked id-unique-22466">firemen</span> that we
<span class="marked id-unique-22403">need</span>," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-22501">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During <span class="marked id-unique-22393">Saturday's</span> news <span class="marked id-unique-22473">conference</span> Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby <span class="marked id-unique-22433">community</span> were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He <span class="marked id-unique-22375">wouldn't</span> provide <span class="marked id-unique-22442">additional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22429">details</span> because that fire
was in another <span class="marked id-unique-22411">jurisdiction</span>.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
<span class="marked id-unique-22378">unattended</span> and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the <span class="marked id-unique-22413">incident</span>.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
<span class="marked id-unique-22425">doesn't</span> understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A <span class="marked id-unique-22396">representative</span> from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-22452">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-22488">Nantes</span>,

caused by a train derailment that set off powerful

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (<span class="marked id-unique-22519">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22561">death</span> toll would <span class="marked id-unique-22528">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-22534">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-22507">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22548">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-22562">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-22530">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-22516">estimate</span> to how many people were <span class="marked id-unique-22508">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-22527">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-22532">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-22529">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-22537">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-22524">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-22517">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-22535">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-22525">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-22520">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-22572">Inc</span>., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-22563">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-22570">President</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22518">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-22521">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22572">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-22526">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-22549">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22574">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-22522">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-22574">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-22557">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-22538">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22578">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22576">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-22577">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-22578">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22576">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-22560">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-22531">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-22577">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22552">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-22505">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-22555">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-22523">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-22570">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-22563">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-22546">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-22541">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-22565">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-22506">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-22564">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22554">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22556">Brunswick</span> and owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22539">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-22559">officials</span>, the blasts took
place <span class="marked id-unique-22512">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-22509">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22511">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-22573">disaster</span> forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-22540">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-22543">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-22566">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-22545">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-22553">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-22573">disaster</span> also forced the town

Quebec Police: More Oil Train Deaths Expected

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-22519">AP</span>) - Fires continued <span class="marked id-unique-22536">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22555">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-22550">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-22514">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-22561">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-22515">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-22545">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-22552">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-22505">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-22527">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-22562">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22548">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-22534">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22507">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-22530">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-22516">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-22508">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-22523">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-22532">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-22509">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-22511">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-22543">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-22510">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22568">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-22557">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-22533">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22547">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22551">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22544">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-22570">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22518">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-22521">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22572">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-22526">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-22522">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-22538">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22578">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22576">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-22577">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-22549">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22574">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-22578">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22576">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-22574">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-22573">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-22560">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-22531">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-22577">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-22563">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-22575">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-22546">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-22541">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-22517">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-22512">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-22563">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-22520">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-22513">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-22542">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-22529">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-22553">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-22535">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-22573">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-22569">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22571">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22567">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-22558">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-22525">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-22537">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22524">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-22506">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22540">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-22539">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-22566">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-22564">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-22554">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22556">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-22528">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-22559">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-22565">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  <span class="marked id-unique-22585">CTV</span> National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-22598">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22599">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22597">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-22593">quickly</span> spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown <span class="marked id-unique-22591">Lac</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22590">Megantic</span>, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police <span class="marked id-unique-22579">spokesperson</span> Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people <span class="marked id-unique-22580">actually</span> found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-22583">might</span> still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
<span class="marked id-unique-22592">happened</span> During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-22600">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train <span class="marked id-unique-22594">got</span> away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told <span class="marked id-unique-22585">CTV</span> News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22589">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in <span class="marked id-unique-22581">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-22600">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-22588">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "started <span class="marked id-unique-22582">rolling</span> down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-22596">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-22595">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-22587">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-22586">afternoon</span> to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks <span class="marked id-unique-22584">full</span>
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

Inferno In Quebec Town When Train Explodes

At least one person has died, <span class="marked id-unique-22585">CTV</span> News reports, after a
freight train pulling tank cars <span class="marked id-unique-22584">full</span> of crude oil exploded
early Saturday in a small Quebec town about 160 miles east
of Montreal.

Authorities confirmed the fatality, <span class="marked id-unique-22585">CTV</span> News says,
"describing the crash site as a 'war zone.' " In a news
briefing, authorities did not report other injuries.

Our Original Post And Updates:

It's hoped that those now feared missing <span class="marked id-unique-22583">might</span> have been
out of town.

According to The Montreal Gazette:

"The train that careened into the center of town in <span class="marked id-unique-22591">Lac</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22590">Megantic</span> early Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-22588">morning</span> was unmanned when it
derailed and exploded in a huge ball of flame, says a
<span class="marked id-unique-22579">spokesperson</span> for the company that owned the locomotive.
"Joseph R. McGonigle confirmed to The Gazette early
Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-22586">afternoon</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-22587">shortly</span> before midnight, the
<span class="marked id-unique-22596">train's</span> conductor stopped in nearby <span class="marked id-unique-22581">Nantes</span>, locked the
brakes and checked to ensure that the rail cars carrying
thousands of liters of crude oil were all securely
attached.  " 'Sometime after (the first conductor left),
the train <span class="marked id-unique-22594">got</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22600">loose</span>,' said McGonigle. ... The locomotive
portion of the <span class="marked id-unique-22589">73-car</span> train <span class="marked id-unique-22580">actually</span> detached half a
mile outside of the small town, he added, but the cars
carrying the oil kept right on <span class="marked id-unique-22582">rolling</span>."  CBC News says
that "<span class="marked id-unique-22595">witnesses</span> reported between four and six explosions
overnight in the town of about 6,000 people. The derailment
<span class="marked id-unique-22592">happened</span> at about 1 a.m. ET. ... It is not yet known if
there are any casualties, but according to Radio-Canada
60 people have been reported missing."

Update at 5:08 p.m. ET. One Fatality Reported:

Police say one person has died in the accident, CBC News
reports. The agency says <span class="marked id-unique-22598">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22599">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22597">Stephen</span> Harper

Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-22608">high</span> speed,
sparking a <span class="marked id-unique-22601">series</span> of explosions.

At <span class="marked id-unique-22646">least</span> 60 people were missing, feared <span class="marked id-unique-22632">dead</span>, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails <span class="marked id-unique-22618">shortly</span> after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the <span class="marked id-unique-22638">sky</span> and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

<span class="marked id-unique-22634">Witnesses</span> said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported <span class="marked id-unique-22604">hearing</span> as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge <span class="marked id-unique-22627">clouds</span> of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the <span class="marked id-unique-22644">disaster</span>.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could <span class="marked id-unique-22615">explode</span>. One carriage remained on fire
almost <span class="marked id-unique-22606">12</span> hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
<span class="marked id-unique-22610">evacuation</span> of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid <span class="marked id-unique-22609">fears</span> that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to <span class="marked id-unique-22603">reach</span> family or friends by <span class="marked id-unique-22607">phone</span>, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed <span class="marked id-unique-22625">late</span> last night.

<span class="marked id-unique-22620">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22621">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22619">Roy-Laroche</span> said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't <span class="marked id-unique-22613">give</span> out any information on what's happening
right now because the <span class="marked id-unique-22605">firemen</span> haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you <span class="marked id-unique-22639">see</span> the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are <span class="marked id-unique-22647">going</span> to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

<span class="marked id-unique-22640">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22642">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22637">Stephen</span> Harper <span class="marked id-unique-22622">took</span> to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of <span class="marked id-unique-22636">track</span> in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22624">New</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22628">Brunswick</span> in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph <span class="marked id-unique-22645">McGonigle</span> said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what <span class="marked id-unique-22626">happened</span>, but the <span class="marked id-unique-22630">engineer</span> did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a <span class="marked id-unique-22614">full</span> report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there <span class="marked id-unique-22611">likely</span> are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that <span class="marked id-unique-22629">quickly</span> into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard <span class="marked id-unique-22631">described</span> the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the <span class="marked id-unique-22635">train's</span> cargo <span class="marked id-unique-22617">spilled</span> into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-22612">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-22623">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be <span class="marked id-unique-22616">called</span> in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to <span class="marked id-unique-22643">help</span> deal with the <span class="marked id-unique-22644">disaster</span>. Officials
said they had asked for <span class="marked id-unique-22643">help</span> from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
<span class="marked id-unique-22602">region</span>, an <span class="marked id-unique-22633">area</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22641">popular</span> with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve
Beauchemin has the latest.  CTV National News: Emotional
toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in <span class="marked id-unique-22649">shock</span> following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-22694">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and <span class="marked id-unique-22698">businesses</span> Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train
carrying crude oil is still <span class="marked id-unique-22670">burning</span> in the eastern Quebec
town of Lac-Megantic Saturday, July 6, 2013. (Surete

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
<span class="marked id-unique-22686">Canada</span>, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22689">death</span> toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-22669">deceased</span>,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22677">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews <span class="marked id-unique-22684">couldn't</span> reach a section
of the town due to fears that <span class="marked id-unique-22697">five</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-22662">tankers</span> cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the <span class="marked id-unique-22697">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22662">tankers</span> with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-22671">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-22664">requested</span> any
<span class="marked id-unique-22696">help</span> from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire <span class="marked id-unique-22685">chief</span> Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-22665">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came <span class="marked id-unique-22695">loose</span>" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-22659">World</span> Inc., the <span class="marked id-unique-22666">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-22678">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22699">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-22660">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-22699">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-22672">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22703">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22700">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-22702">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-22703">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22700">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-22668">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-22702">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22679">73-car</span> train was parked and <span class="marked id-unique-22650">secured</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-22657">Nantes</span>,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late <span class="marked id-unique-22653">Friday</span> night. The <span class="marked id-unique-22661">two</span>
town centres are about 12 <span class="marked id-unique-22667">kilometres</span> apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came <span class="marked id-unique-22695">loose</span>" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-22676">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-22675">started</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22663">rolling</span> down the <span class="marked id-unique-22674">tracks</span>." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-22693">train's</span> engine was found about one <span class="marked id-unique-22682">kilometre</span> from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-22692">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22681">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22687">Brunswick</span> and owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22673">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22667">kilometres</span>
of rail <span class="marked id-unique-22674">tracks</span>.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." <span class="marked id-unique-22691">Witnesses</span> reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as <span class="marked id-unique-22658">high</span> as
300 feet. Amateur <span class="marked id-unique-22651">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22648">videos</span> from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-22688">officials</span>, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular <span class="marked id-unique-22690">area</span> during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a <span class="marked id-unique-22654">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22652">group</span> was set up to <span class="marked id-unique-22696">help</span> track down
residents who <span class="marked id-unique-22684">couldn't</span> immediately be <span class="marked id-unique-22655">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-22656">phone</span>.
The Red <span class="marked id-unique-22683">Cross</span> had set up a shelter Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-22701">afternoon</span> to
<span class="marked id-unique-22680">take</span> in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

One dead, many missing as train explodes in Lac-Megantic
One person has been declared dead after a driverless
freight train carrying oil <span class="marked id-unique-22662">tankers</span> derailed at <span class="marked id-unique-22658">high</span> speed
in the heart of town.

LAC-MEGANTIC, QUE.-First, Bernard Theberge heard the
now haunting rattle of an approaching train. Then he felt
the ground shake.  But it wasn't until the driverless
freight train, laden with <span class="marked id-unique-22662">tankers</span> of volatile crude oil,
hurtled off the track that he instantly perceived the
danger he was in.  Theberge saw and felt the enormous
ball of fire <span class="marked id-unique-22663">rolling</span> towards the Musi-Cafe in this
picturesque lakeside town, where he and the other patrons
were enjoying a beautiful summer's night on the patio.
"It was like an apocalyptic vision," said Theberge, 44,
who suffered burns to his right arm.  He and others on the
patio fled. They were lucky.  On Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-22701">afternoon</span> police
confirmed the <span class="marked id-unique-22689">death</span> of one person in the derailment and the
subsequent explosions that shot flames hundreds of metres
into the air and laid waste to downtown Lac-Megantic.

However, by late evening, Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22677">Guy</span> Lapointe of the Quebec
provincial police, was saying authorities "do expect there
will be more people found <span class="marked id-unique-22669">deceased</span>." The fireball and
<span class="marked id-unique-22649">shock</span> wave from the explosion destroyed 30 buildings and
homes, gutted downtown <span class="marked id-unique-22698">businesses</span> and left dozens of people
- possibly as many as 60 - unaccounted for in this town
of about 6,000 people, east of Sherbrooke.  Hundreds of
people had to scramble for safety, fleeing the intense heat
as the towering flames lit up the night sky.  Theberge,
who works at the Musi-Cafe, said he knows three of the
missing people: fellow employees who haven't responded to
repeated telephone calls. While he and his pals escaped,
those inside the restaurant may have been trapped in an
inferno.  The restaurant, beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-22674">tracks</span> that
pass right through the heart of downtown, is emerging in
eyewitness accounts as ground zero of the deadly explosion.
Yannick Gagne, owner of the Musi-Cafe, said he too is
unable to contact some employees.  Gagne told a radio
station he left the restaurant about 20 minutes before the
first explosion and he could feel the heat of the flames a
<span class="marked id-unique-22682">kilometre</span> away at his home.  Theberge hopped on his bicycle
and got to what he thought was a safe distance away -
until the heat from an explosion, one of <span class="marked id-unique-22697">five</span> between
the 1 a.m. derailment and 4:30 a.m., scorched his arm. He
said there was nothing he and other patrons could do to
<span class="marked id-unique-22696">help</span> those who hadn't fled with them.  <span class="marked id-unique-22691">Witnesses</span> said
the town centre, where there are many popular bars, was
crowded when the train flew off the rails just after 1 a.m.
The initial blast was so intense that Roger Beauchesne,
who was outside his house <span class="marked id-unique-22661">two</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22667">kilometres</span> from downtown,
said he had to <span class="marked id-unique-22680">take</span> cover behind his car to protect himself
from the heat.  Beauchesne said the municipal library,
which is beside the railway <span class="marked id-unique-22674">tracks</span>, was among the buildings
demolished by the blasts, along with Dollarama and the
Metro grocery. Late Saturday firefighters assisted by
specialists from Ultramar were still battling persistent
fires, <span class="marked id-unique-22670">burning</span> despite a steady drizzle.

The cause of the accident is itself turning out to be
stranger than fiction. According to the railway's operator,
the derailed train was a runaway.  <span class="marked id-unique-22678">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22699">Burkhardt</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-22685">chief</span>
executive of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-22659">World</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-22666">parent</span> company of Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the <span class="marked id-unique-22679">73-car</span> train was parked
<span class="marked id-unique-22660">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic after the engineer had <span class="marked id-unique-22668">finished</span>
his <span class="marked id-unique-22702">run</span>. Somehow it headed into town without a driver.
"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-22672">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22703">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22700">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-22702">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-22699">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the brakes
were <span class="marked id-unique-22703">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22700">applied</span> on this train." "We've had a very
good safety record for these 10 years," he said. "Well,
I think we've blown it here."

Like a war zone: Quebec <span class="marked id-unique-22688">officials</span> on fatal train derailment

The 10-year-old railway owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22673">800</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22667">kilometres</span> of
track serving Quebec, <span class="marked id-unique-22681">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22687">Brunswick</span>, Maine and <span class="marked id-unique-22692">Vermont</span>.
Joseph McGonigle, a railway vice-president, told the
Montreal Gazette the conductor stopped the train outside
town just before midnight and locked the brakes, ensuring
that all the cars were <span class="marked id-unique-22650">secured</span>. He then checked into a
Lac-Megantic hotel for the night.  "Sometime after, the
train got <span class="marked id-unique-22695">loose</span>," said McGonigle. "It travelled under
its own inertia to the centre of the town." He said
there are security mechanisms to prevent tampering with
the train, and the conductor had done the proper checks
before leaving the train for the night. The conductor,
he said, should have been the only one who could set
the train in motion.  "We're not sure what happened, but
the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked
the train and was waiting for his relief ... somehow,
the train got released," McGonigle told Reuters.
"That's what confuses us. How did this happen? There are
many fail-safe modes. How this happened is just beyond
us." The Transportation Safety Board of <span class="marked id-unique-22686">Canada</span> is looking
for the black box to confirm the direction and speed of the
train. And the provincial police said they are considering
a possible criminal investigation.  Lt. Lapointe said
officers are collecting eyewitness accounts as well as
<span class="marked id-unique-22651">photos</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22648">videos</span> from cellphones.  They are also looking
into a report that a blaze had <span class="marked id-unique-22675">started</span> before the train
derailed in the town. The <span class="marked id-unique-22657">Nantes</span> fire department, a short
drive from town, confirmed last night that it had received
a call sometime before midnight about a locomotive fire.
"I'm just saying it's one of the possibilities," Lapointe
said Saturday night.  Billowing smoke continued to fill
the sky Saturday <span class="marked id-unique-22701">afternoon</span>.  "We can still see a lot of
black smoke and lots of firefighters. This is so saddening
to see," said Leonard Bedard, 80, who lives about a
<span class="marked id-unique-22682">kilometre</span> away. "They should never allow <span class="marked id-unique-22693">trains</span> carrying
that much oil to pass through towns. It makes absolutely
no sense, and it makes me angry."

Bedard said that is "mostly <span class="marked id-unique-22698">businesses</span> destroyed, but about
30 to 40 houses as well. I hope they rebuild." Worried
residents watched from behind the perimeters set up by
authorities, sick with fear that some of their friends
and loved ones may have died.  "We're told some people are
missing but they may just be out of town or on vacation,"
provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet told reporters. "We're
checking all that. So I can't tell you at the moment
whether there are any victims or people who are injured."
Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant in town, had to be
evacuated from his home.  "Early this <span class="marked id-unique-22676">morning</span> (there was)
a big explosion like an atomic bomb," he said. "It
was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid." He said the
downtown <span class="marked id-unique-22690">area</span> was bustling as the train hurtled in.
"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there. It was a big explosion. It's
a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population."
Demers, who has lived in Lac-Megantic for 45 years,
describes it as a "nice town." "Everybody is very
friendly ... It's like a small village, a beautiful
town. But now it won't be the same." A <span class="marked id-unique-22654">Facebook</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22652">group</span>
was quickly set up to <span class="marked id-unique-22696">help</span> people track down loved ones
who <span class="marked id-unique-22684">couldn't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-22655">reached</span> by <span class="marked id-unique-22656">phone</span>.  About 450 of the
evacuated residents are staying at Polyvalente Montignac,
a local school, where 20 volunteers from the Red <span class="marked id-unique-22683">Cross</span>
are helping out.  "For now we're helping them get
settled in, providing food and beds, as well as helping
them getting in touch with loved ones," said Red <span class="marked id-unique-22683">Cross</span>
spokeswoman Myriam Marotte. "We will continue to assist
as long as the authorities want us to." Beauchesne said
there were 160 firefighters on the scene and there's
a "team spirit" in the town and “everyone is
working together.” Prime Minister <span class="marked id-unique-22694">Stephen</span> Harper, who
was attending the Calgary Stampede, expressed his concern
on Twitter.  “Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted
in Lac-Megantic,” he tweeted. “Horrible news.” In
a statement later, the prime minister added: “We hope
evacuees can return to their homes safely and quickly. The
people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas can rest
assured that our government is monitoring the situation and
we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-22665">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-22671">assistance</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22664">requested</span> by
the province.” Meanwhile, some counted their blessings
that they were not downtown <span class="marked id-unique-22653">Friday</span> night.  Frederique
Mailloux was supposed to meet up with six friends at
the Musi-Cafe to see a popular local singer. Instead,
it was one of the rare occasions she decided to skip a
night out.  “I don't smoke, so I would have been inside
(the restaurant),” she said. “When you think of that,
you are relieved.” With files from Canadian Press

Harper to visit Quebec town devastated by train derailment

Investigators are starting their work to determine what
caused a train derailment in a quiet Que. town. Genevieve

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

<span class="marked id-unique-22768">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22770">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22766">Stephen</span> Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will <span class="marked id-unique-22767">see</span> firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and <span class="marked id-unique-22713">killed</span> at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which <span class="marked id-unique-22757">quickly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22709">spread</span> to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
<span class="marked id-unique-22774">buildings</span> and sent <span class="marked id-unique-22712">large</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22714">fireballs</span> and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

A massive fire sparked by the derailment of a train

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude
oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,
Canada, Saturday, July 6, 2013. The derailment sparked
several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (<span class="marked id-unique-22718">AP</span> Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul
Chiasson) Quebec provincial police said Saturday night
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22760">death</span> toll would <span class="marked id-unique-22727">likely</span> rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found <span class="marked id-unique-22733">deceased</span>,
<span class="marked id-unique-22706">unfortunately</span>," police spokesperson Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22747">Guy</span> Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found <span class="marked id-unique-22761">dead</span>."  Lapointe would not
<span class="marked id-unique-22729">give</span> an <span class="marked id-unique-22715">estimate</span> to how many people were <span class="marked id-unique-22707">unaccounted</span>
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
<span class="marked id-unique-22726">might</span> still <span class="marked id-unique-22731">explode</span>.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
<span class="marked id-unique-22728">lake</span> water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal <span class="marked id-unique-22736">assistance</span> and had not <span class="marked id-unique-22723">requested</span> any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-22716">Denis</span> Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were <span class="marked id-unique-22734">called</span> to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't <span class="marked id-unique-22724">provide</span> additional details because that fire
was in <span class="marked id-unique-22719">another</span> jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway <span class="marked id-unique-22771">Inc</span>., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "<span class="marked id-unique-22762">came</span> loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
<span class="marked id-unique-22769">President</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22717">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-22720">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22771">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-22725">parent</span> company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, <span class="marked id-unique-22748">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22773">Burkhardt</span>
said the train was parked <span class="marked id-unique-22721">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  <span class="marked id-unique-22773">Burkhardt</span> told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't <span class="marked id-unique-22756">understand</span> how the train got away.  "If brakes
<span class="marked id-unique-22737">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22777">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22775">applied</span> on a train, it's going to <span class="marked id-unique-22776">run</span>
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-22777">properly</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22775">applied</span> on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the <span class="marked id-unique-22759">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-22730">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-22776">run</span>.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the <span class="marked id-unique-22751">73-car</span> train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just <span class="marked id-unique-22704">west</span> of Lac-Megantic, <span class="marked id-unique-22754">late</span> Friday night. The <span class="marked id-unique-22722">two</span>
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice <span class="marked id-unique-22769">president</span> at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "<span class="marked id-unique-22762">came</span> loose" in the early <span class="marked id-unique-22745">morning</span> hours Saturday
and "<span class="marked id-unique-22740">started</span> rolling down the tracks." He said the
<span class="marked id-unique-22764">train's</span> engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's <span class="marked id-unique-22705">website</span>, the railway serves Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-22763">Vermont</span>,
Quebec and <span class="marked id-unique-22753">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22755">Brunswick</span> and owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22738">800</span> kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to <span class="marked id-unique-22758">officials</span>, the blasts took
place <span class="marked id-unique-22711">near</span> the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy <span class="marked id-unique-22708">summer</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22710">nights</span>.  The <span class="marked id-unique-22772">disaster</span> forced between
1,<span class="marked id-unique-22739">500</span> and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  <span class="marked id-unique-22742">Shortly</span> following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help <span class="marked id-unique-22765">track</span> down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The <span class="marked id-unique-22744">Red</span> Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
<span class="marked id-unique-22752">take</span> in residents.  The <span class="marked id-unique-22772">disaster</span> also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil <span class="marked id-unique-22741">spilled</span> into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic <span class="marked id-unique-22746">Mayor</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22750">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22743">Roy-Laroche</span> said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.

LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (<span class="marked id-unique-22718">AP</span>) - Fires continued <span class="marked id-unique-22735">burning</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22754">late</span>
Saturday nearly 24 hours after a runaway train carrying
crude oil derailed in <span class="marked id-unique-22749">eastern</span> Quebec, igniting explosions
and fires that destroyed a town's center and <span class="marked id-unique-22713">killed</span> at
least one person. Police said they expected the <span class="marked id-unique-22760">death</span> toll
to increase.

The eruptions sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling
through the streets under the intense heat of towering
<span class="marked id-unique-22714">fireballs</span> and a <span class="marked id-unique-22744">red</span> glow that illuminated the night sky,
witnesses said. Flames and billowing black smoke could
still be seen long after the <span class="marked id-unique-22751">73-car</span> train derailed, and
a fire chief likened the charred scene to a war zone.

Up to 2,000 people were forced from their homes in the
lakeside town of 6,000 people, which is about 155 miles
(250 kilometers) east of Montreal and about 10 miles
(16 kilometers) <span class="marked id-unique-22704">west</span> of the Maine border.

Quebec provincial police Lt. Michel Brunet confirmed that
one person had died. He refused to say how many others
<span class="marked id-unique-22726">might</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-22761">dead</span>, but said authorities have been told "many"
people have been reported missing.

Lt. <span class="marked id-unique-22747">Guy</span> Lapointe, a spokesman with Quebec provincial
police, said: "I don't want to get into numbers, what I
will say is we do expect we'll have other people who will
be found <span class="marked id-unique-22733">deceased</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22706">unfortunately</span>."

Lapointe refused to <span class="marked id-unique-22729">give</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-22715">estimate</span> of people <span class="marked id-unique-22707">unaccounted</span>
for because police were having difficulty getting a
fixed number.

"People are calling in reported love ones missing, some
people are reported <span class="marked id-unique-22722">two</span>, three times missing by different
members of the family," he said.

The derailment caused several tanker rail cars to <span class="marked id-unique-22731">explode</span>
in the downtown, a popular area packed with bars that
often bustles on <span class="marked id-unique-22708">summer</span> weekend <span class="marked id-unique-22710">nights</span>.

Police said the first explosion tore through the town
<span class="marked id-unique-22742">shortly</span> after 1 a.m. local time. The fire then <span class="marked id-unique-22709">spread</span> to
several homes.

"When you <span class="marked id-unique-22767">see</span> the center of your town almost destroyed,
you'll <span class="marked id-unique-22756">understand</span> that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an <span class="marked id-unique-22732">emotional</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22746">Mayor</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22750">Colette</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22743">Roy-Laroche</span> told a televised news briefing.

The cause of the accident was believed to be a runaway
train, the railway's operator said.

The <span class="marked id-unique-22769">president</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-22717">CEO</span> of Rail <span class="marked id-unique-22720">World</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22771">Inc</span>., the <span class="marked id-unique-22725">parent</span>
company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the
train had been parked <span class="marked id-unique-22721">uphill</span> of Lac-Megantic.

"If brakes <span class="marked id-unique-22737">aren't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22777">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22775">applied</span> on a train, it's going
to <span class="marked id-unique-22776">run</span> away," said <span class="marked id-unique-22748">Edward</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22773">Burkhardt</span>. "But we think the
brakes were <span class="marked id-unique-22777">properly</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22775">applied</span> on this train."

<span class="marked id-unique-22773">Burkhardt</span>, who was mystified by the <span class="marked id-unique-22772">disaster</span>, said the
train was parked because the <span class="marked id-unique-22759">engineer</span> had <span class="marked id-unique-22730">finished</span> his <span class="marked id-unique-22776">run</span>.

"We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,"
he said of the decade-old railroad. "Well, I think we've
blown it here."

The blasts <span class="marked id-unique-22762">came</span> over a span of several hours as the fire
tore through the center of town, destroying at least 30
<span class="marked id-unique-22774">buildings</span>. Lines of tall trees in the area looked like
giant standing matchsticks, blackened from bottom to tip.

Witnesses said the eruptions sent many shook residents out
of their slumber and sent them darting through the streets.

Patrons gathered by a nearby bar were sent running for
their lives after the thunderous crash and wall of fire
blazed through the early <span class="marked id-unique-22745">morning</span> sky.

Bernard Theberge, who was outside on the bar's patio at the
time of the crash, feared for the safety of those inside
the popular Musi-Cafe when the first explosion went off.

"People <span class="marked id-unique-22740">started</span> running and the fire ignited almost
instantaneously," he said.

"It was like a movie," said Theberge, who considered
himself fortunate to escape with only second-degree burns
on his right arm.

"Explosions as if it were scripted - but this was live."

Firefighters, including some from Maine, doused the blaze
for hours. Local fire chief <span class="marked id-unique-22716">Denis</span> Lauzon described the
scene as one akin to a war zone.

Dozens of residents gathered hours after the explosion at
the edge of a wide security perimeter and many feared the
worst. About a kilometer (0.6 miles) down the town's main
street, flames danced around a railway tanker that sat at
the edge of the road.

"On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there
were a lot of people there," said Bernard Demers, who
owns a restaurant <span class="marked id-unique-22711">near</span> the blast site. "It was a big
explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the
population."

Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was "like
an atomic bomb. It was very hot. ... Everybody was afraid."

Charles Coue said he and his wife felt the heat as they
sprinted from their home after an explosion went off a
couple of hundred yards (meters) away.

"It went boom and it <span class="marked id-unique-22762">came</span> like a fireball," he said.

<span class="marked id-unique-22719">Another</span> resident Claude Bedard described the scene of the
explosions as "dreadful."

"The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is
gone," he said.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
a <span class="marked id-unique-22712">large</span> but undetermined amount of fuel had also <span class="marked id-unique-22741">spilled</span>
into the Chaudiere (Ah-DER-Re) River. Blanchette said the
73 cars were filled with crude oil, and at least four were
damaged by the explosions and fire.

"We also have a spill on the <span class="marked id-unique-22728">lake</span> and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they <span class="marked id-unique-22752">take</span> their water from
the Chaudiere River."

He added that a mobile laboratory had been set up to
monitor the quality of the air.

Firefighters and rescue workers from several
neighboring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, were <span class="marked id-unique-22734">called</span> in to help deal with
the <span class="marked id-unique-22772">disaster</span>.

Firefighters from northern Maine were also deployed to
the Quebec town, according to a spokesman at the sheriff's
office in Franklin County.

<span class="marked id-unique-22768">Prime</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22770">Minister</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22766">Stephen</span> Harper expressed his sympathy in
a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and
friends of those affected by this morning's tragic train
derailment and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec,"
Harper said.

"We hope evacuees can return to their homes safely and
<span class="marked id-unique-22757">quickly</span>. The people of Lac-Megantic and surrounding areas
can rest assured that our government is monitoring the
situation and we stand by ready to <span class="marked id-unique-22724">provide</span> any <span class="marked id-unique-22736">assistance</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-22723">requested</span> by the province."

The train, reportedly heading toward Maine, belongs to
Montreal Maine & Atlantic. According to the railroad's
<span class="marked id-unique-22705">website</span>, the company owns more than <span class="marked id-unique-22739">500</span> miles (<span class="marked id-unique-22738">800</span>
kilometers) of <span class="marked id-unique-22765">track</span> serving Maine, <span class="marked id-unique-22763">Vermont</span>, Quebec and
<span class="marked id-unique-22753">New</span> <span class="marked id-unique-22755">Brunswick</span>.

Last week a train carrying petroleum products derailed
in Calgary, Alberta, when a flood-damaged bridge sagged
toward the still-swollen Bow River. The derailed rail cars
were removed without spilling their cargo.

The Quebec accident was <span class="marked id-unique-22727">likely</span> to have an impact across the
border. In Maine, environmentalists and state <span class="marked id-unique-22758">officials</span>
had previously raised concerns about the threat of an
accident and a spill from railroad tank cars carrying
crude oil across the state.

The Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway carried nearly 3
million barrels of oil across Maine last year. Each tank
car holds some 30,000 gallons (113,600 liters) of oil.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has begun
developing protection plans for the areas where the <span class="marked id-unique-22764">trains</span>
travel, spokeswoman Samantha Warren said recently.
