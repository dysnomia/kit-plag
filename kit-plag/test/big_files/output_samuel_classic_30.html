Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

That

You <span class="marked id-unique-905">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-906">water</span> <span class="marked id-unique-907">moves</span> fast? You should <span class="marked id-unique-787">see</span> <span class="marked id-unique-908">ice</span>. It <span class="marked id-unique-796">moves</span>

the <span class="marked id-unique-831">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-879">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-870">made</span> it out. <span class="marked id-unique-935">Now</span> we <span class="marked id-unique-936">took</span> an

That
<span class="marked id-unique-814">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-836">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-837">pilot</span>. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-838">show</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-841">show</span> to the

<span class="marked id-unique-861">became</span> <span class="marked id-unique-863">nothing</span>.

<span class="marked id-unique-864">Normally</span>, both your <span class="marked id-unique-865">asses</span> would be <span class="marked id-unique-867">dead</span> as <span class="marked id-unique-869">fucking</span> <span class="marked id-unique-871">fried</span>

you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-876">can't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-888">give</span> you this <span class="marked id-unique-889">case</span>, it <span class="marked id-unique-890">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-892">belong</span> to

You <span class="marked id-unique-905">think</span> <span class="marked id-unique-906">water</span> <span class="marked id-unique-907">moves</span> fast? You should <span class="marked id-unique-787">see</span> <span class="marked id-unique-908">ice</span>. It <span class="marked id-unique-796">moves</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-910">like</span> it has a <span class="marked id-unique-911">mind</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-912">Like</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-914">knows</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-915">killed</span> the <span class="marked id-unique-916">world</span> once
and <span class="marked id-unique-918">got</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-909">taste</span> for <span class="marked id-unique-919">murder</span>. After the <span class="marked id-unique-921">avalanche</span>, it <span class="marked id-unique-923">took</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-713">us</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-924">week</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-926">climb</span> out. <span class="marked id-unique-927">Now</span>, I <span class="marked id-unique-868">don't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-928">know</span> <span class="marked id-unique-929">exactly</span> when we

the <span class="marked id-unique-831">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-879">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-870">made</span> it out. <span class="marked id-unique-935">Now</span> we <span class="marked id-unique-936">took</span> an

<span class="marked id-unique-958">Look</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-959">just</span> because I <span class="marked id-unique-961">don't</span> be <span class="marked id-unique-962">givin'</span> no man a <span class="marked id-unique-851">foot</span> <span class="marked id-unique-938">massage</span>

the <span class="marked id-unique-831">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-879">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-870">made</span> it out. <span class="marked id-unique-935">Now</span> we <span class="marked id-unique-936">took</span> an

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-1062">gonna tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

<span class="marked id-unique-1072">Well, the <span class="marked id-unique-1073">way</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-1074">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1056">shows</span> is, they <span class="marked id-unique-1059">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1075">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1076">show</span>.

Some
<span class="marked id-unique-1091">don't</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-1092">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-1093">nothing</span>. She <span class="marked id-unique-1094">starred</span> in <span class="marked id-unique-1095">one</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-1096">ones</span> that

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1100">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1100">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You see</span>? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-1062">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-1100">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-1100">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-1181">gonna tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1254">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-1181">gonna tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I <span class="marked id-unique-1254">don't know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

You see</span>? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-1181">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-1254">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-1254">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the
spread of the animals is case they ever got off the
island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty
enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied
with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-1181">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-1254">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-1254">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some

swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-1348">gonna tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why <span class="marked id-unique-1385">don't they know</span>? If they <span class="marked id-unique-1385">don't
know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-3276">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-3266">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-3292">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some

don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-3267">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-3278">ones</span> that

You think water moves fast? You should see <span class="marked id-unique-3249">ice</span>. It moves

and got a <span class="marked id-unique-3236">taste</span> for <span class="marked id-unique-3245">murder</span>. After the <span class="marked id-unique-3257">avalanche</span>, it took
us a <span class="marked id-unique-3231">week</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3254">climb</span> out. Now, I don't know <span class="marked id-unique-3252">exactly</span> when we
<span class="marked id-unique-3235">turned</span> on each other, but I know that <span class="marked id-unique-3240">seven</span> of us <span class="marked id-unique-3237">survived</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-3239">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-3251">five</span> made it out. Now we took an

Do you see any <span class="marked id-unique-3304">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you see a slender

it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant

don't get <span class="marked id-unique-3268">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-3273">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by

lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that there is the <span class="marked id-unique-3188">Tec-9</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-3195">crappy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3189">spray</span> gun from <span class="marked id-unique-3190">South</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3193">Miami</span>. This gun is <span class="marked id-unique-3201">advertised</span> as the most <span class="marked id-unique-3226">popular</span> gun
in <span class="marked id-unique-3229">American</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3228">crime</span>. Do you <span class="marked id-unique-3199">believe</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-3270">shit</span>? It <span class="marked id-unique-3230">actually</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-3191">says</span> that in the little <span class="marked id-unique-3198">book</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-3196">comes</span> with it: the most

of that <span class="marked id-unique-3270">shit</span>.

You think water moves fast? You should see <span class="marked id-unique-3249">ice</span>. It moves
like it has a <span class="marked id-unique-3246">mind</span>. Like it <span class="marked id-unique-3248">knows</span> it killed the world once
and got a <span class="marked id-unique-3236">taste</span> for <span class="marked id-unique-3245">murder</span>. After the <span class="marked id-unique-3257">avalanche</span>, it took
us a <span class="marked id-unique-3231">week</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3254">climb</span> out. Now, I don't know <span class="marked id-unique-3252">exactly</span> when we
<span class="marked id-unique-3235">turned</span> on each other, but I know that <span class="marked id-unique-3240">seven</span> of us <span class="marked id-unique-3237">survived</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-3239">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-3251">five</span> made it out. Now we took an
<span class="marked id-unique-3243">oath</span>, that I'm <span class="marked id-unique-3256">breaking</span> now. We <span class="marked id-unique-3242">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3232">we'd</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3241">say</span> it was the
<span class="marked id-unique-3238">snow</span> that killed the other <span class="marked id-unique-3234">two</span>, but it <span class="marked id-unique-3233">wasn't</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-3244">Nature</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-3247">lethal</span> but it <span class="marked id-unique-3253">doesn't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3250">hold</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-3255">candle</span> to man.

Do you see any <span class="marked id-unique-3304">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you see a slender

that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
<span class="marked id-unique-3280">mistake</span>! It all makes <span class="marked id-unique-3271">sense</span>! In a <span class="marked id-unique-3296">comic</span>, you know how you

react to <span class="marked id-unique-3302">bacteria</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3261">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3291">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-3268">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-3273">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-3265">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-3297">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-3282">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-3290">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-3285">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3262">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-3281">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3272">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-3295">connected</span>,
you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-3294">curve</span>, just on opposite <span class="marked id-unique-3289">ends</span>.

Do you see any <span class="marked id-unique-3304">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you see a slender
plastic <span class="marked id-unique-3305">tag</span> clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

You think water moves fast? You should see <span class="marked id-unique-3249">ice</span>. It moves
like it has a <span class="marked id-unique-3246">mind</span>. Like it <span class="marked id-unique-3248">knows</span> it killed the world once

us a <span class="marked id-unique-3231">week</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3254">climb</span> out. Now, I don't know <span class="marked id-unique-3252">exactly</span> when we
<span class="marked id-unique-3235">turned</span> on each other, but I know that <span class="marked id-unique-3240">seven</span> of us <span class="marked id-unique-3237">survived</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-3239">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-3251">five</span> made it out. Now we took an
<span class="marked id-unique-3243">oath</span>, that I'm <span class="marked id-unique-3256">breaking</span> now. We <span class="marked id-unique-3242">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3232">we'd</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3241">say</span> it was the

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
<span class="marked id-unique-3280">mistake</span>! It all makes <span class="marked id-unique-3271">sense</span>! In a <span class="marked id-unique-3296">comic</span>, you know how you

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-3276">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-3266">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-3292">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-3275">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-3277">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-3264">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3274">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-3267">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-3278">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-3301">became</span> nothing.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-3307">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-3313">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-3309">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-3316">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-3312">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-3314">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-3308">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3311">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-3310">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-3315">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-3317">became</span> nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it <span class="marked id-unique-3307">right</span> for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he <span class="marked id-unique-3306">better</span> paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil

lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals <span class="marked id-unique-3306">better</span> than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the <span class="marked id-unique-3307">right</span> man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give

<span class="marked id-unique-3344">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-3356">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-3349">lungs</span>,

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna <span class="marked id-unique-3385">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-3370">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
<span class="marked id-unique-3416">people</span> who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-3364">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-3380">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-3369">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-3371">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-3363">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3368">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-3365">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-3372">ones</span> that

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-3357">can't</span> give you this <span class="marked id-unique-3358">case</span>, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this <span class="marked id-unique-3358">case</span> to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-3360">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, <span class="marked id-unique-3361">just</span> because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a

my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what

Your <span class="marked id-unique-3436">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-3435">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-3434">cells</span>
react to <span class="marked id-unique-3437">bacteria</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-3419">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3430">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-3422">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-3424">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-3421">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-3433">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-3426">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-3429">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-3427">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3420">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-3425">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3423">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-3432">connected</span>,
you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-3431">curve</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-3361">just</span> on opposite <span class="marked id-unique-3428">ends</span>.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna <span class="marked id-unique-3385">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-3360">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Do you see any <span class="marked id-unique-3438">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you see a slender
plastic <span class="marked id-unique-3439">tag</span> clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think <span class="marked id-unique-3415">you're</span> in
a toy store, because <span class="marked id-unique-3415">you're</span> here shopping for an infant

<span class="marked id-unique-3369">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-3371">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-3363">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3368">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-3365">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-3372">ones</span> that

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna <span class="marked id-unique-3385">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-3360">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-3361">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna <span class="marked id-unique-3385">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-3360">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-3361">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see <span class="marked id-unique-3460">ice</span>. It moves

the <span class="marked id-unique-3450">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-3462">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3441">made</span> it out. Now we took an

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage

my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a

you and me! I should've known way <span class="marked id-unique-3440">back</span> when... You know

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some

swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You think water moves fast? You should see <span class="marked id-unique-3460">ice</span>. It moves
like it has a <span class="marked id-unique-3457">mind</span>. Like it <span class="marked id-unique-3459">knows</span> it killed the world once
and got a <span class="marked id-unique-3447">taste</span> for <span class="marked id-unique-3456">murder</span>. After the <span class="marked id-unique-3468">avalanche</span>, it took
us a <span class="marked id-unique-3442">week</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-3465">climb</span> out. Now, I don't know <span class="marked id-unique-3463">exactly</span> when we
<span class="marked id-unique-3446">turned</span> on each other, but I know that <span class="marked id-unique-3451">seven</span> of us <span class="marked id-unique-3448">survived</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-3450">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-3462">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3441">made</span> it out. Now we took an
<span class="marked id-unique-3454">oath</span>, that I'm <span class="marked id-unique-3467">breaking</span> now. We <span class="marked id-unique-3453">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3443">we'd</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3452">say</span> it was the
<span class="marked id-unique-3449">snow</span> that killed the other <span class="marked id-unique-3445">two</span>, but it <span class="marked id-unique-3444">wasn't</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-3455">Nature</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-3458">lethal</span> but it <span class="marked id-unique-3464">doesn't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-3461">hold</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-3466">candle</span> to man.

Like you, I used to think the world was this <span class="marked id-unique-3469">great</span>
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get <span class="marked id-unique-3440">back</span>, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-3441">made</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-3440">back</span>. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the <span class="marked id-unique-4545">name</span> of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will <span class="marked id-unique-4500">know</span> My <span class="marked id-unique-4545">name</span>
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

<span class="marked id-unique-4541">Well</span>, the <span class="marked id-unique-4489">way</span> they <span class="marked id-unique-4538">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4543">shows</span> is, they <span class="marked id-unique-4538">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4573">one</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4544">show</span>. That
<span class="marked id-unique-4543">show's</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4536">called</span> a pilot. Then they <span class="marked id-unique-4544">show</span> that <span class="marked id-unique-4544">show</span> to the
people who <span class="marked id-unique-4538">make</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4543">shows</span>, and on the strength of that <span class="marked id-unique-4573">one</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4544">show</span> they decide if <span class="marked id-unique-4498">they're</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4574">going</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-4538">make</span> more <span class="marked id-unique-4543">shows</span>. Some
pilots <span class="marked id-unique-4497">get</span> picked and <span class="marked id-unique-4576">become</span> television programs. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-4540">don't</span>, <span class="marked id-unique-4576">become</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4575">nothing</span>. She starred in <span class="marked id-unique-4573">one</span> of the ones that

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-4596">right</span>? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

<span class="marked id-unique-4634">Well</span>, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-4627">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-4623">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-4630">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-4626">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-4628">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-4622">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4625">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-4624">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-4629">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-4631">became</span> nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it <span class="marked id-unique-4596">right</span> for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he <span class="marked id-unique-4621">better</span> paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

<span class="marked id-unique-4634">Well</span>, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-4627">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-4623">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-4630">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-4626">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-4628">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-4622">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4625">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-4624">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-4629">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-4631">became</span> nothing.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals <span class="marked id-unique-4621">better</span> than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the <span class="marked id-unique-4596">right</span> man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. <span class="marked id-unique-4596">Right</span>, Omar? Give me Raoul.

<span class="marked id-unique-4626">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-4628">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-4622">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4625">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-4624">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-4629">ones</span> that
<span class="marked id-unique-4631">became</span> nothing.

Your <span class="marked id-unique-4652">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-4651">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-4650">cells</span>
react to <span class="marked id-unique-4653">bacteria</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-4635">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4646">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-4638">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-4640">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-4637">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-4649">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-4642">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-4645">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-4643">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4636">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-4641">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4639">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-4648">connected</span>,
you and I. We're on the same <span class="marked id-unique-4647">curve</span>, just on opposite <span class="marked id-unique-4644">ends</span>.

Do you see any <span class="marked id-unique-4597">Teletubbies</span> in here? Do you see a <span class="marked id-unique-4599">slender</span>
<span class="marked id-unique-4607">plastic</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4598">tag</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4617">clipped</span> to my <span class="marked id-unique-4602">shirt</span> with my name <span class="marked id-unique-4606">printed</span> on

that <span class="marked id-unique-4603">shakes</span> when you <span class="marked id-unique-4605">put</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4604">quarters</span> in it? No? <span class="marked id-unique-4634">Well</span>, that's
what you see at a <span class="marked id-unique-4632">toy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4633">store</span>. And you <span class="marked id-unique-4610">must</span> think you're in
a <span class="marked id-unique-4632">toy</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4633">store</span>, because you're here <span class="marked id-unique-4601">shopping</span> for an <span class="marked id-unique-4613">infant</span>

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like <span class="marked id-unique-4725">they're</span> actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm <span class="marked id-unique-4721">gonna</span> shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm <span class="marked id-unique-4721">gonna</span> shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
<span class="marked id-unique-4721">gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4655">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The <span class="marked id-unique-4684">path</span> of the <span class="marked id-unique-4682">righteous</span> man is <span class="marked id-unique-4699">beset</span> on all <span class="marked id-unique-4679">sides</span> by

Well, the way they make shows is, they make <span class="marked id-unique-4728">one</span> show. That
show's <span class="marked id-unique-4720">called</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-4710">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-4659">can't</span> give you this <span class="marked id-unique-4704">case</span>, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this <span class="marked id-unique-4704">case</span> to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-4658">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, <span class="marked id-unique-4657">just</span> because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
<span class="marked id-unique-4719">glass</span> motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> who you are, I <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> who I am. I'm not a
<span class="marked id-unique-4665">mistake</span>! It all <span class="marked id-unique-4654">makes</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4663">sense</span>! In a <span class="marked id-unique-4672">comic</span>, you <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> how you

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like <span class="marked id-unique-4725">they're</span> actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> exactly when we
turned on each other, but I <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span> that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-4658">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my <span class="marked id-unique-4660">name</span> printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think <span class="marked id-unique-4656">you're</span> in
a toy store, because <span class="marked id-unique-4656">you're</span> here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we <span class="marked id-unique-4721">gonna</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4655">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they <span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span>? If they don't
<span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-4658">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-4657">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the

the amino acid lysine. Unless <span class="marked id-unique-4725">they're</span> continually supplied

it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft

<span class="marked id-unique-4727">know</span>, that means we never told anyone. And if we never

down here. <span class="marked id-unique-4657">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

the <span class="marked id-unique-4748">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-4760">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-4739">made</span> it out. Now we <span class="marked id-unique-4769">took</span> an

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You

swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South

Like you, I used to think the <span class="marked id-unique-4768">world</span> was this <span class="marked id-unique-4767">great</span>
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
<span class="marked id-unique-4768">world</span>, a <span class="marked id-unique-4768">world</span> where chaos rules not order, a <span class="marked id-unique-4768">world</span> where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's <span class="marked id-unique-4768">world</span>, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get <span class="marked id-unique-4738">back</span>, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-4739">made</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-4738">back</span>. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells

swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves

lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a

can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact

you and me! I <span class="marked id-unique-5840">should've</span> known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-5837">strength</span> of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become <span class="marked id-unique-5835">television</span> programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-5838">starred</span> in one of the ones that
became nothing.

what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, <span class="marked id-unique-5842">right</span>? If she start giving

head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She

you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that

morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he <span class="marked id-unique-5841">better</span> paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact
opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by
the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-5848">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a

opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know
why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals <span class="marked id-unique-5841">better</span> than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the <span class="marked id-unique-5842">right</span> man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and <span class="marked id-unique-5877">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5888">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-5880">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-5882">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-5879">swallow</span> it too fast, we choke. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-5884">lungs</span>,
we <span class="marked id-unique-5887">drown</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5885">However</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5878">unreal</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-5883">may</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5881">seem</span>, we are <span class="marked id-unique-5890">connected</span>,

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna <span class="marked id-unique-5919">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a <span class="marked id-unique-5903">pilot</span>. Then they show that show to the
<span class="marked id-unique-5949">people</span> who make shows, and on the <span class="marked id-unique-5897">strength</span> of that one
show they <span class="marked id-unique-5913">decide</span> if they're going to make more shows. Some
<span class="marked id-unique-5902">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-5904">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-5896">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5901">programs</span>. Some

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I <span class="marked id-unique-5891">can't</span> give you this <span class="marked id-unique-5892">case</span>, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this <span class="marked id-unique-5892">case</span> to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-5894">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Look, <span class="marked id-unique-5918">just</span> because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage
don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
<span class="marked id-unique-5952">glass</span> motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger
talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze
my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what
I'm sayin'?

Your <span class="marked id-unique-5970">bones</span> don't <span class="marked id-unique-5969">break</span>, mine do. That's clear. Your <span class="marked id-unique-5968">cells</span>
react to <span class="marked id-unique-5971">bacteria</span> and <span class="marked id-unique-5953">viruses</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5964">differently</span> than mine. You
don't get <span class="marked id-unique-5956">sick</span>, I do. That's also clear. But for some
<span class="marked id-unique-5958">reason</span>, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
<span class="marked id-unique-5955">swallow</span> it too fast, we <span class="marked id-unique-5967">choke</span>. We get some in our <span class="marked id-unique-5960">lungs</span>,

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna <span class="marked id-unique-5919">tell</span> me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took
us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
the slide... and only five <span class="marked id-unique-5894">made</span> it out. Now we took an
oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think <span class="marked id-unique-5950">you're</span> in
a toy store, because <span class="marked id-unique-5950">you're</span> here shopping for an infant

<span class="marked id-unique-5902">pilots</span> get <span class="marked id-unique-5904">picked</span> and become <span class="marked id-unique-5896">television</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5901">programs</span>. Some
don't, become nothing. She <span class="marked id-unique-5898">starred</span> in one of the <span class="marked id-unique-5905">ones</span> that

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna <span class="marked id-unique-5919">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-5894">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-5918">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna <span class="marked id-unique-5919">tell</span> everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-5894">made</span> it back. Hence we die
down here. <span class="marked id-unique-5918">Just</span> as a matter of deductive logic.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually
says that in the little book that comes with it: the most
popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud
of that shit.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving
me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the
head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She
gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that
nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help
you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see <span class="marked id-unique-5990">ice</span>. It moves

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some

swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

and got a <span class="marked id-unique-5977">taste</span> for <span class="marked id-unique-5986">murder</span>. After the <span class="marked id-unique-5998">avalanche</span>, it took
us a <span class="marked id-unique-5972">week</span> to <span class="marked id-unique-5995">climb</span> out. Now, I don't know <span class="marked id-unique-5993">exactly</span> when we
<span class="marked id-unique-5976">turned</span> on each other, but I know that <span class="marked id-unique-5981">seven</span> of us <span class="marked id-unique-5978">survived</span>
the <span class="marked id-unique-5980">slide</span>... and only <span class="marked id-unique-5992">five</span> <span class="marked id-unique-6000">made</span> it out. Now we took an
<span class="marked id-unique-5984">oath</span>, that I'm <span class="marked id-unique-5997">breaking</span> now. We <span class="marked id-unique-5983">said</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5973">we'd</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5982">say</span> it was the
<span class="marked id-unique-5979">snow</span> that killed the other <span class="marked id-unique-5975">two</span>, but it <span class="marked id-unique-5974">wasn't</span>. <span class="marked id-unique-5985">Nature</span> is
<span class="marked id-unique-5988">lethal</span> but it <span class="marked id-unique-5994">doesn't</span> <span class="marked id-unique-5991">hold</span> a <span class="marked id-unique-5996">candle</span> to man.

Like you, I used to think the world was this great
place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where
righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and
if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're
gonna have to pay the price.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get <span class="marked id-unique-5999">back</span>, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never <span class="marked id-unique-6000">made</span> it <span class="marked id-unique-5999">back</span>. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.
