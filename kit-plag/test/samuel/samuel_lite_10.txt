Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells
react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some
reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But
then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft
encounters a black hole does the computer call it an
'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't
know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die
down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

Yeah, I like animals better than people
sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every
time you come home, they act like they haven't seen
you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is
they got different dogs for different people. Like pit
bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give
me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression
on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in
a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant
named Jeb.
