Canada: Train explosions in Lac-Megantic, Quebec

THE centre of a picturesque Canadian town was wiped
out yesterday after a driverless freight train carrying
hundreds of tonnes of crude oil derailed at high speed,
sparking a series of explosions.

At least 60 people were missing, feared dead, after the
runaway train with 73 carriages sped into Lac-Megantic
in Quebec before coming off the rails shortly after 1am
(5am UK time).

Four of the pressurised-tank carriages caught fire. The
subsequent explosions combined into a giant fireball,
with flames shooting into the sky and billowing smoke
visible from several miles away.

Witnesses said the town centre was crowded at the
time. About 6,000 people live in the lakeside town, which
is close to the border with Maine and about 155 miles east
of Montreal.

About 30 buildings in the town centre were destroyed in
the inferno. Residents reported hearing as many as six
loud blasts soon after the derailment.

Huge clouds of thick acrid smoke could be seen still
rising from the centre of Lac-Megantic several hours
after the disaster.

Fire officials said they feared more of the tanker
carriages could explode. One carriage remained on fire
almost 12 hours after the derailment.

Authorities set up a half-mile exclusion zone as 120
firefighters battled to control the blaze, forcing the
evacuation of 1,000 people.

Worried residents looked on amid fears that friends and
loved ones may have died in their homes. Some were unable
to reach family or friends by phone, police said. No
casualties had been confirmed late last night.

Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said: "Many parents are worried
because they haven't been able to communicate with a member
of their family or an acquaintance.

"We can't give out any information on what's happening
right now because the firemen haven't been able to get
close."

He added: "When you see the centre of your town almost
destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves
how we are going to get through this event."

Police spokesman Michel Brunet said: "I can say absolutely
nothing about victims… we've been told about people
who are not answering their phones, but you have to
understand that there are people who are out of town and
on holiday."

Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to release
an initial statement, posting: "Thoughts & prayers are
with those impacted in Lac-Megantic. Horrible news."

The train was run by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic - a
firm that owns roughly 510 miles of track in Maine and
Vermont in the United States, and in Quebec and New
Brunswick in Canada.

Company vice-president of marketing Joseph McGonigle said
no-one had been on board when the train derailed.

He said it was unknown how the train ended up out
of control. It had been parked some distance from the
town during an overnight driver shift change.

"We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did
everything by the book," he said.

"He had parked the train and was waiting for
his relief. Somehow the train got released.

"There appears to be extensive damage to buildings but
we haven't got a full report yet of injuries. But we
understand that there likely are some."

Eyewitness Yvon Rosa had just left a bar when he saw the
train speeding into the middle of the town.

"I have never seen a train travelling that quickly into
the centre of Lac-Megantic," he said.

"I saw the wagons come off the tracks. Everything
exploded. In just one minute the centre of the town was
covered in fire."

Lac-Megantic resident Claude Bedard described the scene as
"dreadful".

"It's terrible," he said. "We've never seen anything
like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was
there is gone."

Restaurant owner Bernard Demers, who had to evacuate his
home after the derailment, said one of the explosions
sounded like an atomic bomb detonating.

He said: "It was very hot. Everybody was afraid."

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the Chaudiere
River.

Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said
communities downstream of Lac-Megantic should be careful
of using river water.

He said: "Right now there is big smoke in the air, so we
have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of
the air.

"We also have a spill on the lake and the river that is
concerning us. We have advised the local municipalities
downstream to be careful if they take their water from
the Chaudiere River."

Firefighters and rescue workers had to be called in from
neighbouring municipalities, including Sherbrooke and
Saint-Georges, to help deal with the disaster. Officials
said they had asked for help from fire services in the
United States.

Lac-Megantic is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships
region, an area popular with tourists that is close to the
border with Maine and Vermont. Quebec is a predominantly
French-speaking province in the eastern half of Canada.
