Police have said they expect more people to be found dead
after a runaway train carrying light crude oil exploded
in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic.

The blast sent a fireball and black smoke into the air,
killing one and forcing the evacuation of 1,000 people.

Dozens of buildings were destroyed in the town, about 250km
(155 miles) east of Montreal.

They include a bar full of customers. Police are trying
to account for dozens of missing people.

The train's cars reportedly uncoupled from a parked engine
and derailed early on Saturday.

Rail company officials said the train had been immobilised
in a neighbouring village before a scheduled crew change,
but for an unknown reason had then started rolling downhill
into Lac-Megantic.

Eyewitnesses said that by the time the driverless train
reached the town it was travelling at considerable speed.

'Like a movie' The search for more bodies is expected to
continue at dawn.

Local media have reported up to 100 people missing.


"We have already confirmed one death and we expect there
will be others," said police spokesman Guy Lapointe.

"We also expect that the number of people reported missing
will be greater than the final death toll."

He said some people had been reported missing several
times by different family members.

Some 120 firefighters have been fighting the blaze, which
has continued for more than 24 hours.

Firefighters from across the border in the US are
assisting.

Eyewitnesses reported that the town centre - where there
are a number of bars - was crowded at the time of the
blast, and that "chaos" ensued.


Firefighters fought the blaze for more than 24 hours
Bernard Theberge, who was on the patio of the Musi-Cafe
at the time, said he was lucky to escape and feared for
those inside the bar.

"It was like a movie," he said, quoted by the Associated
Press news agency. "Explosions as if it were scripted -
but this was live."

A woman described how close she was to one of the wagons.

"There were some sparks, and the car lifted and came to
lie on its side in front of me, but I turned around and
ran without stopping," she told the CBC TV.

The Montreal, Maine & Atlantic train had five locomotive
engines and 73 cars filled with light crude oil, and
was parked in the village of Nantes - about 7km (four
miles) from Lac-Megantic - during an overnight driver
shift-change, a company spokesman told Canada's La Presse
newspaper.

The railway's chairman, Edward Burhardt, quoted by CBC,
said an engineer had parked the train and put the brakes on
"properly" before going to a local hotel for the night.

The cars filled with fuel somehow became uncoupled,
causing them to roll downhill into the town and derail,
said the spokesman, Joe McGonigle.


Canadian PM Stephen Harper: "What has happened is shocking
and truly devastating" "It seems that the brakes were
tight on locomotives," Mr McGonigle told La Presse. "We
found the locomotives higher up, half a mile (800m) away."

Some of the cars exploded, creating a massive fireball
and setting fire to nearby homes and businesses.

A one-kilometre exclusion zone was set up amid fears of
more pressurised containers exploding.

"When you see the centre of your town almost destroyed,
you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we
are going to get through this event," an emotional Mayor
Colette Roy-Laroche told a televised news briefing.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement: "Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of
those affected by this morning's tragic train derailment
and subsequent fires in Lac-Megantic, Quebec.

Some of the train's cargo spilled into the nearby
Chaudiere river, said Environment Quebec spokesman
Christian Blanchette, adding that communities downstream
of Lac-Megantic had been warned to take care if using
river water.

A mobile laboratory had been set up to monitor the quality
of the air, he added.

The train was carrying the crude oil from the Bakken Field
in North Dakota. Montreal, Maine & Atlantic owns more
than 800km (500 miles) of track serving Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick.

A lakeside town that is home to some 6,000 people,
Lac-Megantic is close to the US border with Vermont and
210 km (130 miles) north of Maine's capital, Augusta.
