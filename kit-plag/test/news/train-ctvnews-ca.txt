toll on residents

The residents of Lac-Megantic are in shock following a
series of devastating explosions. Aphrodite Salas has more.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper is set to visit Lac-Megantic,
Que., Sunday, where he will see firsthand the devastation
caused by a train derailment that set off powerful
explosions and killed at least one person.  The derailment
of the train -- which was carrying crude oil -- also set
off a number of fires, which quickly spread to many homes
and businesses Saturday.  The blasts destroyed around 30
buildings and sent large fireballs and mushroom clouds
into the sky.

oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic, Quebec,

several explosions and forced the evacuation of up
to 1,000 people. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Paul

that the death toll would likely rise.  "We do expect
we'll have other people who will be found deceased,
unfortunately," police spokesperson Lt. Guy Lapointe
said during a news conference.  "We also expect that down
the line ... there will be more people reported missing
than people actually found dead."  Lapointe would not
give an estimate to how many people were unaccounted
for. He said emergency crews couldn't reach a section
of the town due to fears that five of the tankers cars
might still explode.  Around 125 firefighters were at
the scene, and many were fighting multiple fires into
the night. They managed to douse the five tankers with
lake water and foam, to keep them from overheating and
exploding.  Local authorities said Saturday that they did
not require federal assistance and had not requested any
help from the military.  "We have all the firemen that we
need," Lac-Megantic fire chief Denis Lauzon said.  How it
happened During Saturday's news conference Lauzon said
that firefighters in a nearby community were called to a
fire on the same train a few hours before the derailment.
He wouldn't provide additional details because that fire
was in another jurisdiction.  Montreal Maine & Atlantic
Railway Inc., which owns the train, says the train was
unattended and "came loose" between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
President and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company
of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, Edward Burkhardt
said the train was parked uphill of Lac-Megantic before
the incident.  Burkhardt told The Canadian Press that he
doesn't understand how the train got away.  "If brakes
aren't properly applied on a train, it's going to run
away," he said. "But we think the brakes were properly
applied on this train." He said the train was parked
for the night because the engineer had finished his run.
A representative from the company told CTV News Saturday
that the 73-car train was parked and secured in Nantes,
Que., just west of Lac-Megantic, late Friday night. The two
town centres are about 12 kilometres apart.  Joe McGonigle,
a vice president at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, said the
train "came loose" in the early morning hours Saturday
and "started rolling down the tracks." He said the
train's engine was found about one kilometre from where
the explosions took place.  Police said it's too early
to speculate what caused the derailment.  According to
the company's website, the railway serves Maine, Vermont,
Quebec and New Brunswick and owns more than 800 kilometres
of rail tracks.  A war zone Lauzon described the scene
on Saturday as a "war zone." Witnesses reported hearing
multiple explosions and seeing flames shoot up as high as
300 feet. Amateur photos and videos from the scene showed
massive balls of fire and clouds of smoke emanating from
the region.  According to officials, the blasts took
place near the downtown core - a popular area during
the busy summer nights.  The disaster forced between
1,500 and 2,000 people from their homes, and a number of
people are still accounted for.  Shortly following the
explosions a Facebook group was set up to help track down
residents who couldn't immediately be reached by phone.
The Red Cross had set up a shelter Saturday afternoon to
take in residents.  The disaster also forced the town
of 6,000 to shut off the drinking water supply after
some crude oil spilled into the nearby Chaudiere River.
Lac-Megantic Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche said trucks full
of potable water have been brought in for the residents.
